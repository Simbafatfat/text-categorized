If anything bad is possible by the government in theory, it\\nalmost always ends up happening in fact.  So the key is to make abuse\\nIMPOSSIBLE.  Question authority, and remember power DOES corrupt.\\n\\nI think one has to regard this whole idea in the sense that it WILL be\\nexpanded to include other data forms, such as data transfer and stored\\ndata. and as such should be treated as if it were expanded (or such\\nexpansion will be almost impossible to stop, using Clipper as a precident).\\nThere was a hint of that in the proposal, remember.  That said, please\\nbear with me, I am not very articulate, so I take more words to say\\nwhat others could say much more briefly.  Thank you.\\n\\n>Once it hits land you can record it if you have telco access.  The\\n>telco isn\\'t supposed to give that without a warrant.  That\\'s the rule\\n>today.\\n\\nAs I suggested this is NOW.  The hint is in the proposal that this or\\nsimilar proposals are being considered for other forms of encryptions\\nsuch as data transfer, data files, and such, largely dependent on how\\nthis thing is accepted or flies.  I think one would be wise to treat\\nthis in the manner one would when (not if) it gets expanded to other\\nareas than cellular phones.  I think this is guaranteed to happen, if\\nthis proposal gets by.  Salami politics.  It has been and is used in\\nseveral other areas, it is certain to be used here.  Government is not\\ngoing to easily give up on the idea that they should be able to eavesedrop\\nwhenever they want to.  \\'Court order required\\' has proven to be a rather\\nflimsy guarantee.  If the case warrants, they can always sieze the\\nmaterial, and force one to give the key, or sit in jail forever on\\nperiodically renewed contempt charges.  So it is not denying the justice\\nsystem the information, nor the ability to lock someone up if guilty\\n(or refuses to divulge the means to access the info - this is not\\nprotected under the Fifth - one can be forced to perform ACTS that would\\nresult in divulging incriminating evidence).  So, blocking restrictions\\non private encryption is not preventing LEGITIMATE law enforcement - it\\ndoes make ILLEGITIMATE law enforcement a bunch more difficult.  Especially\\nfishing expeditions without the target\\'s knowlege.  Don\\'t give up the\\nright to be safe from that - that should be non-negotiable, and Clinton\\nand Co. know it (which is probably why they quietly developed this thing,\\nfiguring if they get it this far, they can ram it on through).  How come\\nthose consulted could be roughly described as \"us insiders\"?  They cannot\\nquietely IMPLIMENT it though, when they ban other schemes to ensure its\\nexclusive use.  Hence the nice PR document to try and reassure everyone.\\nDon\\'t buy into it.  Has government really earned that kind of trust,\\npast or future?  To be secure and free, one must keep government honest\\nand the only way to do that is to make abuse IMPOSSIBLE, not \\'unlikely\\'\\nor \\'difficult\\'.\\n\\n>But even so, the evidence would not be admissible, I think, unless the\\n>judge so ordered.  I think that even interception of the crypttext\\n>without a warrant would be illegal.   Cops can\\'t record today\\'s plain\\n>cellular calls and then ask a judge, \"Hey, can we have permission to\\n>listen to those tapes?\" can they?\\n\\nSo what?  One could use information gained by re-use of the keys (saved\\nafter the last case was finished) or other means (master key, backdoor,\\neasily broken algorithm) to find other evidence which, given to a judge,\\nwould authorize a tap which wouldn\\'t have been possible otherwise.  This\\nhas been the more common manner of abuse of wiretaps in the past...  For\\nlocal cops, this might be workable to keep them honest, but the Feds\\nhave a workaround somehow, BET on it.  Does anyone really believe\\nfor example, that the government will use a scheme NSA cannot listen\\nin on scanning for keywords - either easily defeated in realtime or\\nvia a \\'master key\\'?  I sure don\\'t.\\n\\nThis whole thing sounds like something to eliminate the need to use\\nold-fashioned police work to build a case.  In the past, eavesdropping\\nwas rather easy (with or without a court order).  I think the Law\\nEnforcement community has become a bit spoiled, and will resist changes\\nthat require them to revert to using old-fashioned detective work.  I\\njust find it somewhat surprising coming from a bunch that cares so much\\nabout civil and individual rights, that \"puts people first\".  The question\\nis \"put people first\" to WHERE?\\n\\nWith the innards not being revealed, how is one to be sure there DOESN\\'T\\nexist a \\'master key\\' for use by NSA, etc (so they can do their keyword\\nscan, etc on conversations they routinely monitor, without a specific\\ncourt order)?   Remember, the cellular phone limitiation is only TEMPORARY.\\nBet on it.  And so far I have not heard about police telling people that\\nthey have been tapped and nothing incriminating was found.  What is to\\nkeep them from simply keeping the keys on file for \\'next time\\'? After\\nawhile, they would have quite a collection.  Kept especially for folks\\nthey deem \\'disruptive\\'.  And if they get only one key, that would\\nreduce the search space a lot, unless it is an RSA scheme.  Remember\\nNixon years?  Need for court orders really slowed them down, didn\\'t it?\\n\\nAnd unless the escrow accounts are not government controlled (fat chance!\\nI see one ending up being under, say Treasury, the other under Justice\\n:-)) it could be worth some serious bucks to some folks to get keys to\\na competitor\\'s Clinton Clipper (or descendent when this idea is expanded\\nto be used for all non-government encryption).  Enough bucks would get\\none the keys or the innards for this algorithm.  Perhaps not an important\\nconcern, but given past government behavior and the other problems...\\n\\n>>worse, of course, if the government then uses this \"Clinton Clipper\"\\n>>to argue for restrictions on unapproved encryption.

You\\ncan BET that if Clipper is accepted, that will be next on the agenda.\\nIt is even hinted at in the proposal - read it carefully...

Granted - an exteme expansion of the idea but\\nthe principle holds.  Private stuff should remain private, even from a\\ngovt fishing expedition.  And laws/rules may change in the future as\\nto \\'safeguards\\'.  When it comes to the Fed Government, safeguards are\\npretty meaningless, if they want to do/get something.\\n\\nDon\\'t work so hard to give up some rather treasured rights, or establish\\nbad precidents, please.

Perhaps a\\ncertain professor who likes key banks would be one of the selected\\nexperts... this does seem to expand on some ideas the person was\\nadvocating, if I recall :-).  How would anybody know that what the\\nexperts examine is the same as what will end up being used in the Clipper\\nChip, if it is kept secret?   Perhaps the Clipper will use a crippled\\nversion (with a \\'master key\\' provision), or features not present in the\\nversion subjected for study and evaluation by the experts.  And who\\nchooses the expertes?  The government?  No conflict of interest there...\\n:-)\\n\\nAnd isn\\'t it a REQUIREMENT for any decent encryption scheme that it NOT\\nhave its effectiveness reduced by having the algrorithm widely known?\\nI was lead to believe that one should assume the other side has everything\\nyou have, except for the key(s)... I recall ideas presented to this\\ngroup are rejected if a requirement exists the algorithm be secret...\\n\\nAnother question - since it is a safe bet this Clipper thing would not\\nbe used for government security, they are regarding it as not real secure\\nbut \"good enough\" for common folk.  I think I would like to see a full\\ndescription (not a PR non-statement) of just what \"good enough\" means?\\nI think when saying how strong it is, \"good enough\" really means \"not\\nvery\".  The excuse that other countries have these restrictions is not\\nacceptable:  Other countries do not have our Bill of Rights and\\nConstitution (which the people, not the governments, of those other\\ncountries often regard with envy - what we have as rights they have as\\nrevokable privileges).  And if we expect to retain those rights and\\nprotections, we must not allow them to be gutted because we just GOTTA\\nhave this thing to \\'fight crime\\'.  We have allready have our Bill of\\nRights pretty much torn to shreds.  We should not permit more weakining\\nfor yet another \\'noble cause\\', instead we should be trying to repair\\nthe damage.  Our crime problem may have a number of causes, but \"too\\nmany rights and safeguards\" is not a signifigant one.  A broken court\\nsystem and poor police work are a much more signifigant cause as having\\n\"too many rights\" (disregarding addressing the root causes for crime,\\netc).\\n\\nBTW - those who suggest that this is just an attack on Clinton, believe\\nthis:  I would be going ballistic reagardless WHO seriously proposed\\nthis thing.  It is just another step in a gradual erosion of our rights\\nunder the Constitution or Bill of Rights.

Our agency started to express interest in\\n|> virtual reality(VR).  So far, we do not know much about VR.  All we\\n|> know about are the Hollywood movies \"The Terminater 2\" and \"Lawnmover\\n|> Man\".  We also know something about VR from ABC news magazine and\\n|> Computer Graphics World magazine.\\n\\n\\nUnfortunately, while SGI systems were used to create the special effects\\nfor both Terminator 2 and Lawnmower Man, those are film-quality computer\\ngraphics, rendered in software and written to film a frame at a time.  Each\\nframe of computer animation for those films took hours to render on\\nhigh-end parallel processing computer systems. Thus, that level of graphics\\nwould be difficult, if not impossible, to acheive in real time (30 frames\\nper second).\\n\\n\\n|> \\n|> We certainly want to know more about VR.  Who are the leading\\n|> companies,\\n|> agencies, universities?  What machines support VR (i.e. SGI, Sun4,\\n|> HP-9000, BIM-6000, etc.)?\\n\\n\\nIt depends upon how serious you are and how advanced your application is.\\nTrue immersive visualization (VR), requires the rendering of complex visual\\ndatabases at anywhere from 20 to 60 newly rendered frames per second.  This\\nis a similar requirement to that of traditional flight simulators for pilot\\ntraining. If the frame rate is too low, the user notices the stepping of\\nthe frames as they move their head rapidly around the scene, so the motion\\nof the graphics is not smooth and contiguous.  Thus the graphics system\\nmust be powerful enough to sustain high frame rates while rendering complex\\ndata representations.\\n\\nAdditionally, the frame rate must be constant.  If the system renders 15\\nframes per second at one point, then 60 frames per second the next (perhaps\\ndue to the scene in the new viewing direction being simpler than what was\\nvisible before), the user can get heavily distracted by the medium (the\\ngraphics computer) rather than focusing on the data. To maintain a constant\\nframe rate, the system must be able to run in real-time.  UNIX in general\\ndoes not support real-time operation, but Silicon Graphics has modified the\\nUNIX kernel for its multi-processor systems to be able to support real-time\\noperation, bypassing the usual UNIX process priority-management schemes. \\nUniprocessor systems running UNIX cannot fundamentally support real-time\\noperation (not Sun SPARC10, not HP 700 Series systems, not IBM RS-6000, not\\neven SGI\\'s uniprocessor systems like Indigo or Crimson). Only our\\nmultiprocessor Onyx and Challenge systems support real-time operation due\\nto their Symmetric Multi-Processing (SMP) shared-memory architecture.\\n\\nFrom a graphics perspective, rendering complex virtual environments\\nrequires advanced rendering techniques like texture mapping and real-time\\nmulti-sample anti-aliasing.  Of all of the general purpose graphics systems\\non the market today, only Crimson RealityEngine and Onyx RealityEngine2\\nsystems fully support these capabilities. The anti-aliasing is particularly\\nimportant, as the crawling jagged edges of aliased polygons is an\\nunfortunate distraction when immersed in a virtual environment.\\n\\n\\n|>  What kind of graphics languages are used with VR\\n|> (GL, opengl, Phigs, PEX, GKS, etc.)?\\n\\nYou can use the general purpose graphics libraries listed above to develop\\nVR applications, but that is starting at a pretty low level.

I\\nhave come to the honest conclusion that if there is a deity, it is\\nnothing like the ones proposed by any religion that I am familiar with.\\n Now, if there does happen to be, say, a Christian God, will I be held\\naccountable for such an honest mistake?\\n\\n Sincerely,\\n\\n Ray Ingles               ingles@engin.umich.edu\\n\\n \"The meek can *have* the Earth.

On-ice, the Leafs won the Atlantic Division title but\\noff ice was less happy. A strike by public workers has forced the\\nleafs out of the Newfoundland city for much of the last half of\\nthe seaosn (since mid-Jan). They have played \"home\" games in places\\nlike Montreal, Cornwall and Charlottetown. Their playoff \"home\"\\ngames will be played in the Metro Center in Halifax, NS. One\\ndemostration got violent. Workers attacked a Leafs\\' bus and\\nrocked it and broke windows in the St John\\'s Memorial Stadium.\\nDespite the problems, Toronto officials insist that the Leafs\\nwill return to St John\\'s once the strike ends.\\n===================================================\\nSENATORS SOLD\\nThe New Haven Senators have been sold by Peter Shipman to\\nthe Ottawa Senators NHL organization. They are the only Canadian\\nNHL team with an American AHL affiliate, and have made it clear\\nthey intend to move the team to somewhere in the Canadian Atlantic\\nProvinces. This sale and move has yet to be approved by the AHL\\nhead office, but is expected to pass easily at the general meeting\\nin May. The quote in the story from Jack Butterfield made it \\nclear the league was more interested in the stability of the \\nAHL franchise accompanied by NHL ownership, rather than maintaining\\nthe 56-year history of the AHL in New Haven. \\n\\nThe Senators are currently in serious negotiations with Charlottetown\\nNew Brunswick and are expected to move there.\\n==================================================\\nDALLAS HELPS HAWKS STAY IN MONCTON\\nAfter announcing that they would pull their affiliation out\\nof Moncton, the Winnipeg Jets changed their mind. \\n\\nThe Jets announced the move when they said that they would be slashing\\ntheir minor league roster from 20-something to around a dozen; and they\\nwanted to share with an existing AHL or IHL franchise.\\n\\nEnter the Dallas Lone Stars. Dallas agreed to supply the remaining\\n6 or 8 players to the Moncton franchise. Thus keeping the Hawks\\nin the New Brunswick city.\\n\\nThe deal is for one year and will be extended to three years if\\nthe season ticket base increases to over 3000. The Hawks only sold\\n1400 for this year.\\n============================================================\\nSAINT JOHN FLAMES OFFICIAL\\nThe Calgary Flames have officially signed a deal with the city of\\nSaint John, NB. The Saint John Blue Flames will play in the 6200\\nExhibition Center. The Flames still have to apply for an expansion\\nfrnachise from the AHL but are expected to have no trouble.\\n=========================================================\\nCAPS FOLLOW JACKS TO MAINE\\nDespite rumors to the contrary, the Capitals will follow the Baltimore\\nSkipjacks to Maine. The Caps\\' current farm team, the Baltimore Skipjacks,\\nannounced that they would move to Maine and become the Portland Pirates.\\nThere was much doubt as to if the Caps would follow but they announced\\na limited deal with Portland. They would supply a dozen or so players\\nincluding 2 goalies. They become the third team to announce a limited\\nfarm team along with Moncton and the Capital District Islanders.\\n======================================================\\nAHL GAME OF THE WEEK\\nIn early January, the AHL started a game of the week. The game, produced\\nby, I believe, Pyman Productions, was televised across the Canadian\\nMaritimes and northeastern US. The first few weeks saw two games of\\nthe week, one in Canada and another in the US but since then, there\\nhas been only one. Sunday afternoon and night games were covered and\\nshown on Sportschannel NY and NE in the US and, I believe, Atlantic\\nSports Network in Canada (but I\\'m not sure about that). I am not\\nsure if playoff games will be covered.\\n=====================================================\\nUTICA GONE? SYRACUSE ADDED?\\nThere were heavy rumors that the Utica Devils will not be around next\\nseason. There were rumors that they might be headed to a midwestern\\ncity and that the city of Syracuse is trying to lure them.\\n=====================================================\\nWHAT THE AHL MIGHT LOOK LIKE NEXT YEAR\\n\\nONE OPTION\\t\\t\\t\\tANOTHER OPTION\\n\\t\\t\\t\\nNorthern Division\\t\\t\\tSouthern Division\\nADIRONDACK RED WINGS\\t\\t\\tADIRONDACK\\nSPRINGFIELD INDIANS\\t\\t\\tSPRINGFIELD\\nPROVIDENCE BRUINS\\t\\t\\tPROVIDENCE\\nCD ISLANDERS\\t\\t\\t\\tCDI\\nPORTLAND PIRATES\\t\\t\\tHERSHEY\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tBINGHAMTON\\nSouthern Division\\t\\t\\tROCHESTER\\nHERSHEY BEARS\\t\\t\\t\\tHAMILTON\\nBINGHAMTON RANGERS\\t\\t\\tUTICA\\nROCHESTER AMERICANS\\nHAMILTON CANUCKS\\t\\t\\tAtlantic Division\\nUTICA (?)

But let me give you fair warning: I trashed the ring/pinion gear\\nin the final drive of my K75 (I assume) doing wheelies. And this was \\nNO cheap fix either!! There is some kind of \"slip\" device in the shaft\\nto prevent IT from breaking. Unfortunately, it didn\\'t save the gears!\\n\\n  On the topic of wheelies, the other day I saw a kid on a big Hurricane\\ndo a \"stoppy\"(?), or rear wheelie.

(formerly IMSL and Precision Visuals) is in the\\nprocess of securing sites for beta testing X Exponent Graphics 1.0 \\nand C Exponent Graphics 2.0.  (Both X Exponent Graphics and C Exponent\\nGraphics are 3GL products).  The beta period is from April 26 through \\nJune 18.  The platform is HP9000/700 running under OS 8.07 with \\nansi C 8.71 compiler.  The media will be sent on 4mm DAT cartridge \\ntape.  Here are some of the key facts about the two products.\\n \\nX Exponent Graphics 1.0 key facts:\\n \\n1. Complete collection of high-level 2D and 3D application plot types\\n   available through a large collection of X resources.\\n2. Cstom widget for OSF/Motif developers.\\n3. Built-in interactive GUI for plot customization.\\n4. Easily-implemented callbacks for customized application feedback.\\n5. XEG 1.0, being built on the Xt Toolkit provides the user a widget \\n   library that conforms to the expected syntax and standards familar \\n   to X programmers.\\n6. XEG will also be sold as a bundle with Visual Edge\\'s UIM/X product.\\n   This will enable user to use a GUI builder to create the graphical\\n   layout of an application.\\n \\nC Exponent Graphics 2.0 key facts:\\n \\n1. Written in C for C application programmers/developers.  The library\\n   is 100% written in C, and the programming interface conforms to C\\n   standards, taking advantage fo the most desirable features of C.\\n2. Build-in GUI for interactive plot customization.  Through mouse \\n   interaction, the user has complete interactive graph output control\\n   with over 200 graphics attributes for plot customization.\\n3. Large collection of high-level application functions for \"two-call\"\\n   graph creation.  A wide variety of 2D and 3D plot types are available\\n   with minimal programming effort.\\n4. User ability to interrupt and control the X event.  By controlling\\n   the X event loop, when the user use the mouse to manipulate the  plot\\n   the user can allow CEG to control the event loop or the user can \\n   control the event loop.\\n \\nIf anyone is interested in beta testing either of the products, please\\ncontact Wendy Hou at Visual Numerics via email at hou@imsl.com or call\\n713-279-1066.\\n \\n \\n-- \\nJaclyn Brandt\\njbrandt@NeoSoft.com\\n--\\n',\n",

A columnist for the St. \\nPaul \"Pioneer Press\" wrote an article giving the \"inside scoop\" on the \\nissue.  There are three local sites competing for a team and three possible \\ncandiates to move to the Twin Cities.  First the sites: Target Center, Civic \\nCenter (St. Paul), and yes, even the Met Center.  The columnist was pretty \\nconfident that Minnesota will get a team, and that the Target Center will \\nultimately win out.  He argued, however, that the competition from the other \\ntwo sites will delay the process considerably.  Without the \\ninter-site competition, the columnist (sorry, I can\\'t remember his name) \\nbelieves that Minnesota would have a team by the 1994-95 season.  Also, \\nbecause of the situation with the Timberwolves, things will be delayed \\nuntil (unless) the city of Minneapolis takes over the Target Center.  \\nHowever, they are unlikely to do so until the Met Center is destroyed, \\nbecause the city will lose money if there is competition from the Met for \\nconventions and short-term events (even with hockey at Target).  To add to \\nthis mess, a STUDY (6 to 12 months) is going to be conducted on the future \\nviability of the Met Center, which obviously delays the process even \\nfurther.  I hope that the study is cancelled, which will have the effect of \\nknocking the Met Center out of the running and perhaps encouraging \\nMinneapolis to take over the Target Center sooner. The city would be\\nbe even more encourged if the wrecking ball is taken to the Met, \\nwhich may happen.\\n\\tRegarding possible candidates, the three teams are \\nHartford, Tampa Bay, and New Jersey.  I would prefer the Devils (Minnesota \"\\nIce Demons?\") although the Lightning may have potential.  Although it hasn\\'t \\nbeen announced yet, it looks like 6 neutral site games will be played at the \\nTarget Center next year.  Apparently the Devils are interested in playing in \\nas many of those six games as possible, and I wouldn\\'t be surprised to see \\nHartford and Tampa show up there either.\\tSo, Minnesota may end up \\ngetting another team, but it may take a few years.\\n\\n\\t\\n\\tGo Sabres!\\n\\t\\n\\tRobert Andolina (former Buffalonian living in Minneapolis)\\n\\trandolin@polisci.umn.edu\\n',\n",

He couldn't hit a\\nbull in the ass with a banjo!! Al must remember a few years back when Mick \\nscored 3 goals in one period against the Caps in a 5-3 Isles win. I was there\\nand was astonished as was the rest of the crowd. Wake-up Al!!! Years later he's\\ngotten worse. He's a cheap shot artist and always ends up getting\\nstupid/senseless penalties. I think he would make a good police officier!!!\\n\\nAs for Pilon, he can't carry the puck out to center ice by himself. He either\\nmakes a bad pass resulting in a turnover, or he attempts to bring the puck \\ntowards the neutral zone and skates right into an opposing skater. He can't\\nstay on his skates with most forwards or centers. He either falls down or \\ncommitts a penalty. Call up somebody from Capital District AL!!!!!\\n\\nAs far as the playoffs, the Isles are as difficult to figure out as the Caps.\\nTwo good teams with talent but so inconsistent. They should meet in the first\\nround. The Isles seem to play up to the level of their competition so they\\nshould play well against Jersey tonite. It'll probably be another tight 1-goal\\ngame as the last 20 games hve been for the Isles. I wish when the get a lead\\nthey could continue to pour it on instead of settling back into a defensive\\nshell and letting the opposition get back in the game. Al MUST understand he\\ncan't do with this team what he did with the 80-83 Isles. maybe Al should got\\nto. Where is Bobby Nystrom?? Clark Gilles?? John Tonelli??

Well, for these guys, splitfires\\nincreased performance by increasing TORQUE.  They weren\\'t focusing\\non horsepower numbers.\\n\\nNow how does this related to us high performance pilots?  Well, that\\ndepends.  Do you pilot a high performance 2- or 4-cylinder machine?\\nIn the case of 4-cylinders, splitfires would increase overall torque,\\nbut 4\\'s make more top end horsepower with its torque packed down low.\\nSo for 4\\'s, splitfires would not significantly increase power.\\n\\nBut what about twins?...  Many of you 4 guys laugh at some of us twins,\\nbut many times we carry less weight which sometimes can make up for\\nthe hp loss (see Doug Polen vs. Scott Russell, Daytona 1992).  However,\\ntwins make more torque thoughout their powerbands.   So how does this\\ntranslate?  Increased torque should \"theoretically\" help twins make\\nmore power.  Splitfire claims that there should be not extra mods\\nor anything made, just stick \\'em in.\\n\\nNow I don\\'t know about all of this (and I\\'m trying to catch up with\\nsomebody about it now), but Splitfires should help twins more than\\n4\\'s.        \\n\\nAs far as racing teams....

Once again, to not believe in God is different than saying  \\nI BELIEVE that God does not exist. I still maintain the position, even \\nafter reading the FAQs, that strong atheism requires faith.\\n\\nBut first let me say the following.\\nWe might have a language problem here - in regards to \"faith\" and\\n\"existence\". I, as a Christian, maintain that God does not exist.\\nTo exist means to have being in space and time. God does not HAVE\\nbeing - God IS Being. Kierkegaard once said that God does not\\nexist, He is eternal. With this said, I feel it\\'s rather pointless\\nto debate the so called \"existence\" of God - and that is not what\\nI\\'m doing here. I believe that God is the source and ground of\\nbeing. When you say that \"god does not exist\", I also accept this\\nstatement - but we obviously mean two different things by it. However,\\nin what follows I will use the phrase \"the existence of God\" in it\\'s\\n\\'usual sense\\' - and this is the sense that I think you are using it.\\nI would like a clarification upon what you mean by \"the existence of\\nGod\".\\n \\nWe also might differ upon what it means to have faith. Here is what\\nWebster says:\\n\\nfaith \\n1a: allegiance to duty or a person: LOYALTY\\nb  (1): fidelity to one\\'s promises\\n   (2): sincerity of intentions\\n2a (1): belief and trust in and loyalty to God\\n   (2): belief in the traditional doctrines of a religion\\nb  (1): firm belief in something for which there is no proof\\n        ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n   (2): complete trust\\n3: something that is believed esp. with strong conviction; esp: a system \\n   ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\nof religious beliefs\\nsyn see BELIEF\\n\\n\\n\\nOne can never prove that God does or does not exist. When you say\\nthat you believe God does not exist, and that this is an opinion\\n\"based upon observation\", I will have to ask \"what observtions are\\nyou refering to?\" There are NO observations - pro or con - that\\nare valid here in establishing a POSITIVE belief. All observations\\ncan only point you in a direction - a direction that we might even\\nbe predisposed to (by predisposed I mean, for example, people whoes \\npartents \"believe in God\" also tend to). To actually draw a conclusion\\nabout the \"existence\" or \"non-existence\" of God requires a leap - and\\nyou have made this leap when you actively say \"I believe that God  \\ndoes/does not exist\". Personally, I think that both statements are\\nmisguided. Arguing over the \"existence\" of God is precisely the wrong way\\nto find Him (and yes, I use \"Him\" because a personal God is the only \\nviable concept (IMO) - if a person wants to use \"She\" go ahead. Of course \\nGod is neither He nor She - but we have no choice but to \\nanthropomorphise. If you want me to explain myself further I\\'ll be \\nglad to.) \\n\\n\\n\\nAnd please, if someone does not agree with me - even if they violently \\ndisagree - it\\'s in no ones advantage to start name calling. If a person \\nthinks I\\'ve misunderstood something in the FAQs, or if they they think \\nI have not read them well enough, just point out to me the error of my \\nways and I correct the situation.

If you have anonymous FTP access, connect to rtfm.mit.edu [18.172.1.27].\\n   Go to the directory /pub/usenet/alt.atheism, and you\\'ll find the latest\\n   versions of the FAQ files there.\\n\\n   FTP is a a way of copying files between networked computers.  If you\\n   need help in using or getting started with FTP, send e-mail to\\n   mail-server@rtfm.mit.edu with\\n\\n      send usenet/news.answers/ftp-list/faq\\n\\n   in the body.\\n\\n4. There are other sites which also carry news.answers postings.  The article\\n   \"Introduction to the news.answers newsgroup\" carries a list of these\\n   sites; the article is posted regularly to news.answers.\\n\\n5. If you don\\'t have FTP, send mail to mail-server@rtfm.mit.edu\\n   consisting of the following lines:\\n\\n      send usenet/news.answers/finding-sources\\n      send usenet/alt.atheism/faq\\n      send usenet/alt.atheism/introduction\\n      send usenet/alt.atheism/logic\\n      send usenet/alt.atheism/resources\\n\\n5. (Penultimate resort)  Send mail to mail-server@mantis.co.uk consisting of\\n   the following lines:\\n\\n      send atheism/faq/faq.txt\\n      send atheism/faq/logic.txt\\n      send atheism/faq/intro.txt\\n      send atheism/faq/resource.txt\\n\\n   and our poor overworked modems will try and send you a copy of the files.\\n   There\\'s other stuff, too; interesting commands to try are \"help\" and\\n   \"send atheism/index\".\\n\\n6. (Last resort)  Mail mathew@mantis.co.uk, or post an article to the\\n   newsgroup asking how you can get the FAQ files.  You should only do this\\n   if you\\'ve tried the above methods and they\\'ve failed; it\\'s not nice to\\n   clutter the newsgroup or people\\'s mailboxes with requests for files.\\n   it\\'s better than posting without reading the FAQ, though!  For instance,\\n   people whose email addresses get mangled in transit and who don\\'t have \\n   FTP will probably need assistance obtaining the FAQ files.\\n\\n\\nmathew\\nÿ\\n',\n",
              " 'From: gnohmon@ssiny.UUCP (Ralph Betza)\\nSubject: dynamic SqueezeTitle configuration in *twm\\nKeywords: TWM, twm, vtwm, tvtwm, ctwm\\nOrganization: Systems Strategies, Inc., NY, NY\\nLines: 123\\n\\nI consider TWM-style Squeezed Titles indispensable in a window\\nmanager. I like to have two tall xterm windows visible at the same\\ntime, with no overlap; and since two windows aren\\'t enough, I have\\nother xterm windows underneath them, with exactly the same positioning.\\n\\nIn case you\\'re not familiar with Squeezed Titles, here\\'s a crude\\npicture:\\n\\n ====================== Figure 1 ====================================\\n |\\n |    +---------+                   +---------+          +=========+\\n |    + title A +                   + title B +          + title C +\\n |    +------------------------+    +------------------------------+\\n |    +   this is the          +    + window B hides window C, but +\\n |    +     body of the        +    + you can still see C\\'s title  +\\n |    +      window, window A  +    + which is squeezed right.     +\\n |    +------------------------+    +------------------------------+\\n |\\n ====================== Figure 1 ====================================\\n\\nSqueezed titles allow me to have about 5 such windows in each stack,\\nwith easy access; and 3 per stack is usually more than I really\\nneed, since I also insist on having a virtual WM.\\n\\nThe only problem is that the title location is static, that is,  it\\nis configured in .twmrc, and in order to change it you have to edit\\nthat file and restart the window manager. Doing so is cumbersome and\\ntime-consuming.\\n\\nTherefore, I have implemented f.squeeze{ left, center, right }\\nfunctions in my own copy of vtwm; the idea being that with one click\\nof a button, you can change this:\\n\\n    +---------+\\n    + title A +\\n    +------------------------+\\n    +   this is the          +\\n    +     body of the        +\\n    +      window, window A  +\\n    +------------------------+\\n\\nto this:\\n\\n                   +---------+\\n                   + title A +\\n    +------------------------+\\n    +   this is the          +\\n    +     body of the        +\\n    +      window, window A  +\\n    +------------------------+\\n\\n ===============\\n\\nOkay. So far, so good. Now, how the heck do I get them to put this\\ninto the next \"official\" twm, and the next tvtwm, and the next vtwm,\\nand the next ctwm? And the next xyztwm that I never heard of?\\n\\nOne way would be to post, in comp.windows.x, a description of this\\nenhancement, together with an explanation of why I think it is a\\nVery Good Thing, and hope that someone reads it. :-)\\n\\nIn case it isn\\'t already clear why I think it\\'s a Very Good Thing,\\nlook back up at Figure 1, and picture window A moved over on top of\\nwindows B and C; now window A\\'s title hides Window B\\'s title;\\nbut when you hit f.squeezecenter, the result is:\\n\\n        +=========+   +---------+   +=========+\\n        + title B +   + title A +   + title C +\\n        +-------------------------------------+\\n        +   this is the body of the window,   +\\n        +   window A, which is on top.        +\\n        +-------------------------------------+\\n\\n ===================\\n\\nThe rest of this posting explains how to implement it, based on my\\nX11R4 copy of vtvwm.shar; it\\'s just a sketch because posting the\\nfull diffs would be too long.\\n\\nThe key to this enhancement is to add the following lines in the\\nExecuteFunction() routine in menus.c:\\n\\n#ifdef SHAPE\\n\\tcase F_SQUEEZELEFT:\\n\\t{\\tstatic SqueezeInfo left_squeeze = { J_LEFT, 0, 0 };\\n\\t\\tif (DeferExecution (context, func, Scr->SelectCursor))\\n\\t\\t  return TRUE;\\n\\n\\t\\ttmp_win->squeeze_info = &left_squeeze;\\n\\t\\tSetFrameShape( tmp_win );\\n\\t\\tbreak;\\n\\t}\\n\\t.... and similarly for squeezeright ( J_RIGHT ) and\\n\\tsqueezecenter ( J_CENTER ) ...\\n#endif\\n\\n( Of course, you also have to define F_SQUEEZELEFT in parse.h\\n  and add\\n    { \"f.squeezeleft\", FKEYWORD, F_SQUEEZELEFT },\\n     ... and so forth ...\\nto parse.c\\n\\nIn order to use these functions, add something like the\\nfollowing to your .twmrc file:\\n\\nButton2 = m | s : w|v|d|r|i|t|door : f.squeezecenter\\n\\n =================\\n\\nAbout a year ago, I posted this, but our news was broken and I\\n*think* it didn\\'t get out.\\n\\nSince then, \"blast\" has appeared in comp.sources.x, Volume 19,\\nIssue 41; you could use blast to achieve a similar effect, by\\nchiseling away at an mwm-style wide title.

Call 1-800-AMA-JOIN.\\n\\nStep 2) After you become a member, they will ship your bike, UNCRATED to \\njust about anywhere across the fruited plain for a few hundred bucks.\\n\\nI have used this service and have been continually pleased.  They usually\\nonly take a few days for the whole thing, and you do not have to prepare\\nthe bike in any way (other than draining the gas).  Not to mention that\\nit is about 25% of the normal shipping costs (by the time you crate a bike\\nand ship it with another company, you can pay around $1000)\\n\\n\\n________________________________________________________________________\\nNick Coburn                     DoD#6425                      AMA#679817\\n                  '88CBR1000              '89CBR600\\n                       coburnn@spot.colorado.edu\\n________________________________________________________________________\\n\\n\\n\",\n",

Should either of the two new \\nteams not play next season they would have priority drafting position in \\n1994.\\n\\n        The owners announced the 1994 draft will be in Hartford and the \\n1995 draft in Winnipeg.

Answers to some frequently asked questions:\\n \\n Q: Why are the Montreal Canadiens called the Habs?\\n A: Most of the team during the 40-50\\'s was made up of people who lived in \\nand around Montreal.

Short-\\nhanded goals do count for +/-.\\n \\n Q: What is the five-hole?\\n A: The space between a goalie\\'s pads. There are five major scoring zones: \\n(1) upper left corner of goal, (2) upper right, (3) lower left, (4) lower \\nright, and (5) five-hole.\\n \\n Q: What is the meaning of throwing an octopus on the ice?\\n A: This tradition began in Detroit in the 1950\\'s when two best-of-seven \\nseries were required to win the Stanley Cup. Every time Detroit won a \\ngame, an octopus with one less arm was thrown on the ice.\\n\\n Q: Who was the first woman to play in an NHL game?\\n A: Manon Rheaume, a 20-year-old goaltender, became the first woman ever \\nto play in an NHL game on September 23, 1992 when she started in net for \\nthe expansion Tampa Bay Lightning in an exhibition against the St. Louis \\nBlues. Rheaume played the first period before 8,223 at the 10,400-seat \\nExpo Hall on the Florida State Fairgrounds and allowed two goals on nine \\nshots. She left with the score tied 2-2, although the Lightning ultimately \\nlost the game, 6-4.\\n\\n Q: What is the richest contract in NHL history?\\n A: Mario Lemieux, the superstar center of the Pittsburgh Penguins, signed \\nthe richest contract in NHL history, a seven-year deal believed to be \\nworth about $42 million.

Seems only the SDCNs realize how much baseball is\\na *team* game, combining efforts from every player for the win.\\n\\nConsider the Red Sox game last night.  The Sox won 4-3 in the bottom\\nof the 13th.  Who won the game?\\n\\n-Clemens pitched a strong nine (?) innings, allowing only two runs.\\n-Ryan pitched a couple shutout innings, though he needed some excellent\\n defensive plays behind him to do so.\\n-Quantrill pitched a couple of innings, gave up the go-ahead run, and\\n got credited with the win when the Sox scored two in the bottom of\\n the inning.\\n\\nLooks like a team effort to me!  Yet only Quantrill got credit for\\nthe win.\\n\\nHow about the offense?\\n-Dawson and Vaughn hit (I think) HRs early in the game.  Without either\\n one, the Sox would have lost in nine.\\n-Quintana led off the 13th with a solid single.\\n-Zupcic pinch-ran for Quintana, providing the speed to go from first\\n to third when...\\n-Cooper ripped a *second* single in the inning.\\n-Melvin avoided the DP, getting the run home with a sac fly.  Not much of\\n a help, but it was something.\\n-Scrub Richardson then hit a double, scoring the speedy Cooper all the\\n way from first!  (Hill's lack of defense helped.)\\n\\nCooper and Zupcic were credited with runs, Melvin and Richardson were\\ncredited with RBIs.  But it seems to me that it was Quintana's hit\\nthat set up the whole inning!  And did Melvin really contribute as\\nmuch as Richardson?\\n\\nFurthermore, people seem to consider RBIs to be more significant than\\nruns.  Did Melvin contribute more than Cooper?  Cooper provided the\\ngame-winning baserunner, and moved the tying run to third base with\\nonly one out!\\n\\nAssigning credit based on Runs and RBIs is clearly ridiculous.  You\\ncan argue that OBP and SLG don't show you who came through in the\\nclutch, but R&RBI don't do any better.  At least OBP and SLG don't\\n*claim* to try to tell you that.\\n\\nHere's to the Red Sox who contributed to last night's victory.\\nAll 20 of them!\\n\\n-Valentine\\n\",\n",

A family sedan designed to be\\noperable at 85mph doesn\\'t suddenly become operable at 130mph because\\nyou added some plastic aero effects, slightly wider tires, and a much\\nlarger engine.  That\\'s what the SHO is -- a slightly modified family\\nsedan with a powerful engine.  They didn\\'t even bother improving the\\n*brakes.*\\n\\nThe Mustang is essentially the same deal as the SHO -- a big power\\nplant stuck in a mid-size sedan, with almost no other modifications.\\nI have real-life experience with the Mustang -- it handles like a\\nbrick (except when you\\'re invoking oversteer, of course, something I\\npersonally avoid doing on the highway) and stopping power is\\ninadequate even from 80mph.

All of these\\ncars are fairly expensive -- but so are the parts that make them\\ndrivable at high speed.  This should be elementary.\\n\\nThere are a few things to keep in mind about Europe, since you brought\\nit up.  My Autobahn knowledge is admittedly second-hand, but I believe\\nthe following to be true:\\n\\n1. Drivers are much better disciplined in Europe than they are here.\\n2. The roads comprising the Autobahn are much better designed than\\n   they are here, and usually include animal fences.  This makes them\\n   far more predictable than most US highways.\\n3. Not all of Europe is the Autobahn.  Most places in Europe have\\n   speed limits that aren\\'t out-of-line with what we used to have in\\n   the US -- if my friends weren\\'t lying to me they\\'re typically not\\n   much higher than 120km/h.\\n\\nI strongly suspect you won\\'t find a lot of Rabbit owners doing 120mph\\n(nearly 200km/h) on the Autobahn, but I could be wrong.

EDT\\n\\n     THE PRESIDENT:  Good morning ladies and gentlemen.  It\\'s\\nan honor for me to welcome the University of Maine Black Bears, the\\nwinner of the NCAA Division I hockey national championship to the\\nRose Garden and the White House.  I understand from Senator Mitchell\\nthat this is the first team from the University of Maine every to win\\na national championship.  And we\\'re glad to have them here.\\n\\n     I\\'m inspired not only by how the team pulled together to\\nwin the championship, but how the entire state pulled together to\\ncheer them onto victory.\\n\\n     Coming from a state that is also relatively small in\\nsize, but also filled with pride and tradition and community, I can\\nunderstand how the people of Maine must feel about the Black Bears.\\nIn our state people are still talking about the time we won the\\nOrange Bowl over the number one ranked football team, and that was\\nback in 1978.  I\\'m sure that 15 years from now, the people of Maine\\nwill as proud of this team as they are today.\\n\\n     You know, in my state football is a slightly more\\npopular sport than hockey.  We don\\'t have a lot of ice.  (Laughter.)\\nBut after spending three months getting banged around in this town, I\\ncan understand a little more about hockey than I did before I came\\nhere.  Hockey is a tough game.  It\\'s a hard-hitting sport.  It does\\nhave one virtue though, there\\'s a penalty for delay of game.  I wish\\nwe had that rule in the Senate.  (Laughter.)\\n\\n     In government as in hockey, leadership is important.  In\\nthe United States Senate, our team has a great captain, the Majority\\nLeader and the senior Senator from Maine, George Mitchell; junior\\nSenator -- Cohen looks so young, I can\\'t imagine.  (Laughter.)  I\\'m\\nactually bitter about Senator Cohen because he looks so much younger\\nthan me.\\n\\n     On your hockey team, the captain Jim Montgomery has done\\na great job.  He scored the winning goal late in the championship\\ngame, leading you to a come-from-behind victory -- something else I\\nknow a little bit about.\\n\\n     Sport brings out the best in individuals and in teams\\nand in communities.  I share the pride that Senator Mitchell and\\nSenator Cohen and Congressman Andrews and all the people of Maine\\nmust feel for the Black Bears who have shown us all how to play as a\\nteam, how to bring out the best in one another, and how to come from\\nbehind.\\n\\n     I think it\\'s important, as I ask young people from\\naround America who have achieved outstanding things in working\\ntogether, to come here to the White House to be recognized and\\nappreciated by their country, to remember that those kinds of values\\nand those kinds of virtues need to be ingrained in all of us for all\\nof our lives.\\n\\n     We now have another role model, and I\\'m glad to have\\nthem here today.  (Applause.)\\n\\n     (The President is presented with team jersey.)\\n(Applause.)\\n\\n     THE PRESIDENT:  That\\'s great.  I love it.  It\\'s beautiful.\\n(Applause.)\\n\\n     (The President is presented with an autographed stick.)\\n\\n     THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you.  That\\'s great.  (Applause.)\\n\\n                             * * * * * *\\n\\n     Q  Mr. President, did you authorize the move on Waco\\nthis morning, sir?\\n\\n     THE PRESIDENT:  I was aware of it.  I think the Attorney\\nGeneral made the decision.  And I think I should refer all questions\\nto her and to the FBI.\\n\\n     Q  Did you have any instructions for her as to how it\\nshould be executed?\\n\\n     THE PRESIDENT:  No, they made the tactical decisions.\\nThat was their judgment, the FBI.\\n\\n     Q  Is this a raid?\\n\\n     THE PRESIDENT:  And I will -- I want to refer you to --\\ntalk to the Attorney General and the FBI.  I knew it was going to be\\ndone, but the decisions were entirely theirs, all the tactical\\ndecisions.\\n\\n     Q  What did you and Senator Mitchell talk about this\\nmorning?\\n\\n     Q  Any chance for that stimulus package?\\n\\n     THE PRESIDENT:  Senator Mitchell ought to pay my\\nquarter.  (Laughter.)  I was in there -- (laughter).\\n\\n     SENATOR MITCHELL:  You have to pay that quarter.\\n\\n     THE PRESIDENT:  I was ready.  (Laughter.)  Senator\\nMitchell, he\\'s worth a quarter any day.\\n\\n     Q  Any chance for your bill, sir?\\n\\n     THE PRESIDENT:  We talked about what was going to happen\\nthis week in the Senate and about what other meetings we\\'re going to\\nhave for the rest of the week.  We only had about five minutes to\\ntalk.  And we agreed we\\'d get back together later, around noon, and\\ntalk some more.\\n\\n     Q  Senator Dole said over the weekend that your\\ncompromise is no compromise.\\n\\n     THE PRESIDENT:  Well, I know he did, but, look, Senator\\nDole and a lot of the other Republicans now in the Senate voted for\\nthe same kind of thing for Ronald Reagan in 1983; and our research\\nindicates that a majority of them over time voted for a total of 28\\nemergency spending measures totalling over $100 billion when Reagan\\nand Bush were President, in those administrations.  And many of those\\npurposes were not nearly as worthy as putting the American people\\nback to work.  I don\\'t want to go back and revisit every one, but you\\n\\n\\ncan do it.  You can look at the research there.  So this position\\nthey\\'re taking is not credible.  We have a very tough five-year\\ndeficit reduction plan.  All these costs are covered during that time\\nand then some.  And the very people that are saying this has all got\\nto be paid for don\\'t have much of a history on which to base their\\nposition.  They\\'ve got 12 years of vote for stimulus measures of this\\nkind that had very little to with putting the American people back to\\nwork.  So I think we\\'ve got a chance to work it out, and I\\'m hopeful.\\nWe\\'ll see what happens today and tomorrow.  I\\'m feeling pretty good\\nabout it.\\n\\n     THE PRESS:  Thank you\\n\\n                                 END       10:10 A.M.

The Cryptography \\nFAQ is posted to the newsgroups sci.crypt, sci.answers, and news.answers\\nevery 21 days.\\n\\n\\nContents:\\n\\n* In mathematical terms, what is a private-key cryptosystem?\\n* What is an attack?\\n* What's the advantage of formulating all this mathematically?\\n* Why is the one-time pad secure?\\n* What's a ciphertext-only attack?\\n* What's a known-plaintext attack?\\n* What's a chosen-plaintext attack?\\n* In mathematical terms, what can you say about brute-force attacks?\\n* What's a key-guessing attack? What's entropy?\\n\\n\\n* In mathematical terms, what is a private-key cryptosystem?\\n\\n  A private-key cryptosystem consists of an encryption system E and a\\n  decryption system D. The encryption system E is a collection of\\n  functions E_K, indexed by ``keys'' K, mapping some set of\\n  ``plaintexts'' P to some set of ``ciphertexts'' C. Similarly the\\n  decryption system D is a collection of functions D_K such that\\n  D_K(E_K(P)) = P for every plaintext P.  That is, succesful decryption\\n  of ciphertext into plaintext is accomplished using the same key\\n  (index) as was used for the corresponding encryption of plaintext\\n  into ciphertext.  Such systems, wherein the same key value is used to\\n  encrypt and decrypt, are also known as ``symmetric'' cryptoystems.\\n\\n* What is an attack?\\n\\n  In intuitive terms a (passive) attack on a cryptosystem is any method\\n  of starting with some information about plaintexts and their\\n  corresponding ciphertexts under some (unknown) key, and figuring out\\n  more information about the plaintexts. It's possible to state\\n  mathematically what this means. Here we go.\\n\\n  Fix functions F, G, and H of n variables. Fix an encryption system E,\\n  and fix a distribution of plaintexts and keys.\\n\\n  An attack on E using G assuming F giving H with probability p is an\\n  algorithm A with a pair f, g of inputs and one output h, such that\\n  there is probability p of computing h = H(P_1,...,P_n), if we have\\n  f = F(P_1,...,P_n) and g = G(E_K(P_1),...,E_K(P_n)). Note that this\\n  probability depends on the distribution of the vector (K,P_1,...,P_n).\\n\\n  The attack is trivial (or ``pointless'') if there is probability at\\n  least p of computing h = H(P_1,...,P_n) if f = F(P_1,...,P_n) and\\n  g = G(C_1,...,C_n). Here C_1,...,C_n range uniformly over the possible\\n  ciphertexts, and have no particular relation to P_1,...,P_n. In other\\n  words, an attack is trivial if it doesn't actually use the encryptions\\n  E_K(P_1),...,E_K(P_n).\\n\\n  An attack is called ``one-ciphertext'' if n = 1, ``two-ciphertext'' if\\n  n = 2, and so on.\\n\\n* What's the advantage of formulating all this mathematically?\\n\\n  In basic cryptology you can never prove that a cryptosystem is secure.\\n  Read part 3: we keep saying ``a strong cryptosystem must have this\\n  property, but having this property is no guarantee that a cryptosystem\\n  is strong!''\\n\\n  In contrast, the purpose of mathematical cryptology is to precisely\\n  formulate and, if possible, prove the statement that a cryptosystem is\\n  strong. We say, for example, that a cryptosystem is secure against\\n  all (passive) attacks if any nontrivial attack against the system (as\\n  defined above) is too slow to be practical. If we can prove this\\n  statement then we have confidence that our cryptosystem will resist\\n  any (passive) cryptanalytic technique. If we can reduce this statement\\n  to some well-known unsolved problem then we still have confidence that\\n  the cryptosystem isn't easy to break.\\n\\n  Other parts of cryptology are also amenable to mathematical\\n  definition. Again the point is to explicitly identify what assumptions\\n  we're making and prove that they produce the desired results. We can\\n  figure out what it means for a particular cryptosystem to be used\\n  properly: it just means that the assumptions are valid.\\n\\n  The same methodology is useful for cryptanalysis too. The cryptanalyst\\n  can take advantage of incorrect assumptions. Often he can try to\\n  construct a proof of security for a system, see where the proof fails,\\n  and use these failures as the starting points for his analysis.\\n  \\n* Why is the one-time pad secure?\\n\\n  By definition, the one-time pad is a cryptosystem where the\\n  plaintexts, ciphertexts, and keys are all strings (say byte strings)\\n  of some length m, and E_K(P) is just the sum (let's say the exclusive\\n  or) of K and P.\\n\\n  It is easy to prove mathematically that there are _no_ nontrivial\\n  single-ciphertext attacks on the one-time pad, assuming a uniform\\n  distribution of keys. Note that we don't have to assume a uniform\\n  distribution of plaintexts. (Here's the proof: Let A be an attack,\\n  i.e., an algorithm taking two inputs f, g and producing one output h,\\n  with some probability p that h = H(P) whenever f = F(P) and\\n  g = G(E_K(P)) (i.e., g = G(K + P)). Then, because the distribution of\\n  K is uniform and independent of P, the distribution of K + P must also\\n  be uniform and independent of P. But also the distribution of C is\\n  uniform and independent of P. Hence there is probability exactly p\\n  that h = H(P) whenever f = F(P) and g = G(C), over all P and C. Thus\\n  a fortiori A is trivial.)\\n\\n  On the other hand the one-time pad is _not_ secure if a key K is used\\n  for more than one plaintext: i.e., there are nontrivial\\n  multiple-ciphertext attacks. So to be properly used a key K must be\\n  thrown away after one encryption. The key is also called a ``pad'';\\n  this explains the name ``one-time pad.''\\n\\n* What's a ciphertext-only attack?\\n\\n  In the notation above, a ciphertext-only attack is one where F is\\n  constant. Given only some information G(E_K(P_1),...,E_K(P_n)) about\\n  n ciphertexts, the attack has to have some chance of producing some\\n  information H(P_1,...,P_n) about the plaintexts. The attack is trivial\\n  if it has just as good a chance of producing H(P_1,...,P_n) when given\\n  G(C_1,...,C_n) for random C_1,...,C_n.\\n\\n  For example, say G(C) = C, and say H(P) is the first bit of P. We can\\n  easily write down an attack---the ``guessing attack,'' which simply\\n  guesses that H(P) is 1. This attack is trivial because it doesn't use\\n  the ciphertext: it has a fifty-fifty chance of guessing correctly no\\n  matter what. On the other hand there is an attack on RSA which\\n  produces one bit of information about P, with 100% success, using C.\\n  If it is fed a random C then the success rate drops to 50%. So this is\\n  a nontrivial attack.\\n\\n* What's a known-plaintext attack?\\n\\n  The classic known-plaintext attack has F(P_1,P_2) = P_1,\\n  G(C_1,C_2) = (C_1,C_2), and H(P_1,P_2) depending only on P_2.\\n  In other words, given two ciphertexts C_1 and C_2 and one decryption\\n  P_1, the known-plaintext attack should produce information about the\\n  other decryption P_2.\\n\\n  Note that known-plaintext attacks are often defined in the literature\\n  as producing information about the key, but this is pointless: the\\n  cryptanalyst generally cares about the key only insofar as it lets him\\n  decrypt further messages.\\n\\n* What's a chosen-plaintext attack?\\n\\n  A chosen-plaintext attack is the first of an increasingly impractical\\n  series of _active_ attacks on a cryptosystem: attacks where the\\n  cryptanalyst feeds data to the encryptor. These attacks don't fit into\\n  our model of passive attacks explained above. Anyway, a\\n  chosen-plaintext attack lets the cryptanalyst choose a plaintext and\\n  look at the corresponding ciphertext, then repeat until he has figured\\n  out how to decrypt any message. More absurd examples of this sort of\\n  attack are the ``chosen-key attack'' and ``chosen-system attack.''\\n\\n  A much more important form of active attack is a message corruption\\n  attack, where the attacker tries to change the ciphertext in such a\\n  way as to make a useful change in the plaintext.\\n\\n  There are many easy ways to throw kinks into all of these attacks:\\n  for instance, automatically encrypting any plaintext P as\\n  T,E_K(h(T+R+P),R,P), where T is a time-key (sequence number) chosen anew\\n  for each message, R is a random number, and h is a one-way hash\\n  function. Here comma means concatenation and plus means exclusive-or.\\n\\n* In mathematical terms, what can you say about brute-force attacks?\\n\\n  Consider the following known-plaintext attack. We are given some\\n  plaintexts P_1,...,P_{n-1} and ciphertexts C_1,...,C_{n-1}. We're\\n  also given a ciphertext C_n. We run through every key K. When we find\\n  K such that E_K(P_i) = C_i for every i < n, we print D_K(C_n).\\n\\n  If n is big enough that only one key works, this attack will succeed\\n  on valid inputs all the time, while it will produce correct results\\n  only once in a blue moon for random inputs. Thus this is a nontrivial\\n  attack. Its only problem is that it is very slow if there are many\\n  possible keys.\\n\\n* What's a key-guessing attack? What's entropy?\\n\\n  Say somebody is using the one-time pad---but isn't choosing keys\\n  randomly and uniformly from all m-bit messages, as he was supposed to\\n  for our security proof. In fact say he's known to prefer keys which\\n  are English words. Then a cryptanalyst can run through all English\\n  words as possible keys. This attack will often succeed, and it's much\\n  faster than a brute-force search of the entire keyspace.\\n\\n  We can measure how bad a key distribution is by calculating its\\n  entropy. This number E is the number of ``real bits of information''\\n  of the key: a cryptanalyst will typically happen across the key within\\n  2^E guesses. E is defined as the sum of -p_K log_2 p_K, where p_K is\\n  the probability of key K.\\n\",\n",

There is no much of\\nopinion on how good it is compared to the industry leader Stacker 3.0.\\n(Superstor Pro is not considered since it is slower than Stacker although\\njust as reliable - BYTE Magazine\\'s conclusion ;-) ), so it\\'s hard to make\\nany decision to go with Stacker or with DoubleDisk Gold v6.0. \\nHowever, it seems that at $39.95, it is quite a buy.\\n\\nBuddy Christyono\\nbuddy@optics.ece.wisc.edu\\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\\nsummary of replies\\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\\nHello Buddy,\\n\\nI do not have DD Gold 6.0 experience.  I just ordered it.  I currently have\\nDD 2.3 (the last version).  I am very pleased with its performance.\\n\\nHere is my suggestion...\\n\\n1)  If you do not have any compression software currently, I would go with\\n\\tDOS 6.0\\'s compression.  All the discussion on the net indicates that\\n\\tfor $50 you get the compression (built into the OS), plus the other\\n\\tutilities that you would pay way more than $50 for.  Besides, you \\n\\tare now at DOS6.0 (whatever that means...)\\n\\n2)  If you have DoubleDisk 2.3 already (like I do), the cost is $29.95\\n\\tfor the upgrade.  After thinking about it and asking the net, I\\n\\tdecided that I could not go wrong with the update cost!\\n\\tI have never suffered from performance of DD.  I have a 12ms HD with\\n\\tlarge SW packages in both compressed and uncompressed format.  It\\n\\tworks great.  Not delays.  I think the \"A\" is better than \"B\" \\n\\targuements are a lot of bunk... they are all comparable in performance.\\n\\tI am looking forward to being able to \"LOADHIGH\" the DD sw.  That\\n\\thas been an annoyance.\\n\\n3)  If you have Stacker, et.al. currently, I would not see it worth the\\n\\teffort to upgrade.\\n\\nJust my $.02 ...\\n\\nRegards,\\nMark Bagdy\\n----------------------------------------------------------------\\nBuddy,\\n\\nI got the same mailer. About 2 weeks ago I got DDG and installed it. The\\ndocumentation was, in my opinion, easy to follow. I used the automatic\\ninstallation (not the custom) and everything went smoothly.\\n\\nThere were some specific instructions on a readme file for dealing with 386max\\n& QEMM. DDG has an uninstall (unlike DOS6.0) if you need it. My system has a\\n203Mb hard drive. before installing DDG I had ~5Mb free. After DDG I had\\n~197Mb free. Pretty good statistics considering that my 8Mb permanent windows\\nswap file stayed on the uncompressed portion (along with other drivers and\\nsuch).\\n\\nI have had no problems whatsoever. I have noticed no slowdown (other than it\\ntakes a little longer to boot) either in windows or dos. So far I am a very\\nhappy camper.\\n\\n-Bruce\\n-- \\n  Bruce F.

It was very easy to install.\\nThe only problem I had was with Castle Wolfenstein 3-D.  I assumed the game\\nwas trying to bypass DOS disk access and moved the game to the non-compressed\\nregion of the disk.  Since then the game has never given me a problem. \\nThere was never any damage to the DoubleDisk drive.\\n\\tCompression performance for the whole disk has held steady \\naround 1.8:1.

Can read TIFF images, if you know their dimensions\\n  [PC and Macs]\\n\\nLabVIEW 2\\n---------\\n  LabVIEW is used as a framework for image processing tools. It provides a\\n  graphical programming environment using block diagram sketch is the\\n  \"program\" with graphical elements representing the programming elements.\\n  Hundreds of functions are already available and are connected using a\\n  wiring tool to create the block diagram (program).  Functions that the\\n  block diagrams represent include digital signal processing and\\n  filtering, numerical analysis, statistics, etc.  The tool allows any\\n  Virtual Instrument (VI, a software file that looks and acts like a real\\n  laboratory instrument) to be used as a part of any other virtual\\n  instrument.\\n\\n  National Instruments markets plug-in digital signal processing (DSP)\\n  boards for Macintoshs and PC compatables that allow real-time\\n  acquisition and analysis at a personal computer.  New software tools for\\n  DSP are allowing engineers to harness the power of this technology. The\\n  tools range from low-level debugging software to high-level block\\n  diagram development software.  There are three levels of DSP programming\\n  associated with the NB-DSP2300 board and LabVIEW:\\n  Use of the NB-DSP2300 Analysis Library: FFTs, power spectra, filters\\n  routines callable from THINK C and Macintosh Programers Workshop (MPW) C\\n  that execute on the NB-DSP2300 board. There is an analysis Virtual\\n  Interface Library of ready-to-use VIs optimized for the NB-DSP2300.\\n\\n  Use of the National Instruments Developers Toolkit that includes an\\n  optimizing C compiler, an assembler and a linker for low-level\\n  programming of the DSP hardware.  This approach offers the highest level\\n  of performance but is the must difficult in terms of ease of use.\\n\\n  Use of the National Instruments Interface Kit software package which has\\n  utility functions for memory management data communications and\\n  downloading code to the NB-DSP2300 board. (This is the easiest route for\\n  the development of custom code.)\\n\\nUltimage Concept VI\\n-------------------\\n  Concept VI  by Graftek-France is a family of image processing Virtual\\n  Instruments (VIs) that give LabVIEW 2 (described above) users high-end\\n  tools for designing, integrating and monitoring imaging control systems.\\n  A VI is a software file that looks and acts like a real laboratory\\n  instrument. Typical applications for Concept VI include thermography,\\n  surveillance, machine vision, production testing, biomedical imaging,\\n  electronic microscopy and remote sensing.\\n\\n  Ultimage Concept VI addresses applications which require further\\n  qualitative and quantitative analysis.  It includes a complete set of\\n  functions for image enhancement, histogram equalization, spatial and\\n  frequency filtering, isolation of features, thresholding, mathematical\\n  morphology analysis, density measurement, object counting, sizing and\\n  characterization.\\n\\n  The program loads images with a minimum resolution of 64 by 64, a pixel\\n  depth of 8, 16, or 32 bits, and one image plane.  Standard input and\\n  output formats include PICT, TIFF, SATIE, and AIPD.  Other formats can\\n  be imported.\\n\\n  Image enhancement features include lookup table transformations, spatial\\n  linear and non-linear filters, frequency filtering, arithmetic and logic\\n  operations, and geometric transformations, among others.  Morphological\\n  transformations include erosion, dilation, opening, closing, hole\\n  removal, object separation, and extraction of skeletons, among others.\\n  Quantitative analysis provides for objects\\' detection, measurement, and\\n  morphological distribution.  Measures include area, perimeter, center of\\n  gravity, moment of inertia, orientation, length of relevant chords, and\\n  shape factors and equivalence.  Measures are saved in ASCII format.  The\\n  program also provides for macro scripting and integration of custom\\n  modules.\\n\\n  A 3-D view command plots a perspective data graph where image intensity\\n  is depicted as mountains or valleys in the plot.  The histogram tool can\\n  be plotted with either a linear or logarithmic scale. The twenty-eight\\n  arithmetic and logical operations provide for: masking and averaging\\n  sections of images, noise removal, making comparisons, etc.  There are\\n  13 spatial filters that alter pixel intensities based on local\\n  intensity.  These include high-pass filters for contrast and outlines.\\n  The frequency data resulting from FFT analysis can be displayed as\\n  either the (real , imaginary ) components or the (phase, magnitude)\\n  data.  The morphological transformations are useful for data sharpening\\n  and defining objects or for removing artifacts.\\n\\n  The transformations include: thresholding, eroding, dilating and even\\n  hole filling.\\n\\n  The program\\'s quantitative analysis measurements include: area,\\n  perimeter, center of mass, object counts, and angle between points.\\n\\n  GTFS, Inc. 2455 Bennett Valley Road #100C Santa Rosa, CA 95494\\n  707-579-1733\\n\\nIPLab Spectrum\\n--------------\\n  IPLAB Spectrum supports image processing and analysis but lacks the\\n  morphology and quantitative analysis features provided by\\n  Graftek-FranceUs Ultimage Concept VI.  Using scripting tools, the user\\n  tells the system the operations to be performed. The problem is that far\\n  too many basic operations require manual intervention. The tool\\n  supports: FFTs, 16 arithmetic operations for pixel alteration, and a\\n  movie command for cycling through windows.\\n\\n\\nMacintosh-based tools\\n=====================\\n\\nNCSA Image, NCSA PalEdit and more\\n---------------------------------\\n  NCSA provides a whole suite of public-domain visualization tools for the\\n  Macintosh, primarily aimed at researchers wanting to visualize results\\n  from numerical modelling calculations.

Once an image has been imported it can be Rre-touchedS with\\n  various editing tools typical of those used in Macintosh-based RpaintS\\n  applications.  These include an eraser, pencil, brush and air brush.\\n  Advanced RpasteS tools that control the interaction between a pasted\\n  selection and the receiving site have also been incorporated.  For\\n  example, all red pixels in a selection can easily be preventing from\\n  being pasted. Photoshop has transparencies ranging from 0 to 100%,\\n  allowing you to create ghost overlays.  RPhoto-editingS tools include\\n  control of the brightness and contrast, color balancing, hue/saturation\\n  modification and spectrum equalization.  Images can be subjected to\\n  various signal processing algorithms to smooth or sharpen the image,\\n  blur edges, or locate edges.  Image scaling is also supported.\\n\\n  For storage savings, the images can be compressed using standard\\n  algorithms, including externally supplied compression such as JPEG,\\n  availlable from Storm Technologies.

Several steps are often required to\\n  accomplish that which can be done in a single step using Photoshop.  The\\n  application requires a great deal of available disk space as one can\\n  easily end up with images in the 30 MB range.  The program provides a\\n  variety of powerful selection tools including the \"auto selection tool\"\\n  which lets the user choose image areas on the basis of color, close\\n  hues, color range and mask.\\n\\nImageStudio: Don\\'t know...\\n\\n  Letraset USA 40 Eisenhower Drive Paramus, NJ 07653 201-845-6100\\n\\nDapple Systems\\n--------------\\n  \"High resolution image analysis software provides processing tools to\\n  work with multiple images, enhance and edit, and measure a variety of\\n  global or feature parameters, and interpret the data.\"\\n\\n  Dapple Systems, 355 W.

Image Analyst lets users configure\\n  sophisticated image processing and measurement routines without the\\n  necessity of knowing a programming language.  It is designed for such\\n  tasks at computing number and size of cells in images projected by video\\n  cameras attached to microscopes, or enhancing and measuring distances in\\n  radiographs.\\n\\n  Image Analyst provides users with an array of field-proven video\\n  analysis techniques that enable them to easily assemble a sequence of\\n  instructions to enhance feature appearance; count objects; determine\\n  density, shape, size, position, or movement; perform object feature\\n  extraction; and conduct textural analysis automatically.  Image Analyst\\n  works with either a framegrabber board and any standard video camera, or\\n  a disk-stored image.\\n\\n  Within minutes, without the need for programming, the Image Analyst user\\n  can set up a process to identify and analyze any element of a image.\\n  Measurements and statistics can be automatically or semi-automatically\\n  generated from TIFF or PICT files or from captured video tape images.\\n  Image Analyst recognizes items in images based on their size, shape and\\n  position.  The tool provides direct support for the Data Translation and\\n  Scion frame grabbers. A menu command allows for image capture from a VCR\\n  video camera or other NTSC or PAL devices.\\n\\n  There are 2 types of files, the image itself and the related Sequence\\n  file that holds the processing, measurements and analysis that the user\\n  defines.  Automated sequences are set up in Regions Of Interest (ROI)\\n  represented by movable, sizable boxes atop the image.  Inside a ROI, the\\n  program can find the distance between two edges, the area of a shape,\\n  the thickness of a wall, etc.  Image Analyst finds the center, edge and\\n  other positions automatically. The application also provides tools so\\n  that the user can work interactively to find the edge of object. It also\\n  supports histograms and a color look-up table (CLUT) tool.\\n\\n  Automatix, Inc. 775 Middlesex Turnpike Billerica, MA 01821 508-667-7900\\n\\nIPLab\\n-----\\n  Signal Analytics Corp. 374 Maple Ave. E Vienna, VA  22180 703-281-3277\\n  FAX 703-281-2509\\n\\n  \"Menu-driven image processing software that supports 24-bit color or\\n  pseudocolor/grayscale image display and manipulation.\"\\n\\nMAP II\\n------\\n  Among the Mac GIS systems, MAP II distributed by John Wiley has\\n  integrated image analysis.\\n\\nIMAGE\\n-----\\n  from Stanford : Try anonymous ftp from sumex-aim.stanford.edu\\n  It has pd source for image v2, and ready to run code for a mac under\\n  image v3.\\n\\n\\n\\nWindows/DOS PC-based tools\\n==========================\\n\\nCCD\\n---\\n  Richard Berry\\'s CCD imaging book for Willamon-Bell contains (optional?)\\n  disks with image manipulating software.

It is called HIPS, and deals with sequences of\\n  multiband images in the same way it deals with single images.  It has\\n  been growing since we first wrote it, both by additions from us as well\\n  as a huge user-contributed library.\\n\\n  Feature description\\n\\n  HIPS  is  a  set  of  image  processing  modules  which together provide\\n  a  powerful  suite  of  tools  for  those interested in research,\\n  system  development  and  teaching. It  handles  sequences  of  images\\n  (movies)  in precisely the same manner as single frames.\\n\\n  Programs and subroutines have been developed  for simple image\\n  transformations, filtering, convolution, Fourier and other transform\\n  processing, edge detection  and line  drawing   manipulation, digital\\n  image compression and transmission  methods, noise generation, and image\\n  statistics computation. Over 150 such  image transformation programs\\n  have been developed.  As a result, almost any image processing  task\\n  can be performed quickly and conveniently. Additionally, HIPS allows\\n  users to easily integrate  their  own custom  routines.   New users\\n  become effective using HIPS on their first day.\\n\\n  HIPS features images that are  self-documenting.   Each image stored  in\\n  the  system  contains  a  history  of the transformations that have been\\n  applied to that image.   HIPS includes  a  small  set of subroutines\\n  which primarily deals with a standardized  image sequence  header,  and\\n  a  large library  of  image  transformation tools in the form of UNIX\\n  ``filters\\'\\'.  It comes complete with source  code,  on-line manual\\n  pages, and on-line documentation.\\n\\n  Host Configuration Requirements\\n\\n  Originally  developed at  New  York  University,  HIPS  now represents\\n  one of the most extensive and flexible vision and image  processing\\n  environments currently available.  It runs under the UNIX operating\\n  system.  It is modular  and  flexible, provides automatic documentation\\n  of its actions, and is almost entirely independent of special equipment.\\n  HIPS is now in use on a variety of computers including Vax and\\n  Microvax, Sun, Apollo,  Masscomp,  NCR Tower, Iris, IBM AT, etc.\\n  For image display and input, drivers are supplied for the Grinnell and\\n  Adage (Ikonas) image processors, and the Sun-2, Sun-3, Sun- 4, and\\n  Sun-386i consoles.  We also  supply  user-contributed drivers  for  a\\n  number of  other framestores and windowing packages (Sun gfx, Sun\\n  console, Matrox VIP-1024, ITI IP-512, Lexidata,  Macintosh II, X\\n  windowing system, and Iris).  The Hipsaddon package includes an\\n  interface  for the  CRS-4000. It  is  a  simple matter to interface HIPS\\n  with other frame- stores, and we can put interested users in touch with\\n  users who  have interfaced HIPS with the Arlunya and Datacube Max-\\n  Video. HIPS can be easily adapted for other  image  display devices\\n  because 98% of HIPS is machine independent.\\n\\n  Availability\\n\\n  HIPS has proven itself a highly flexible  system,  both as  an\\n  interactive  research tool, and for more production- oriented tasks. It\\n  is both easy to use, and quickly adapted and extended to new uses. HIPS\\n  is supplied on magnetic tape in UNIX tar format (either reel- to-reel or\\n  Sun  cartridge), and comes with source code, libraries, a library of\\n  convolu- tion masks, and on-line documentation and manual pages.\\n\\n  Michael Landy SharpImage Software P.O.

MIRA gives\\n  workstation level performance on 386/486 DOS computers using SVGA cards in\\n  256 color modes up to 1024x768. MIRA contains a very handsome/functional\\n  GUI which is mouse and keystroke operated. MIRA reads/writes TIFF and FITS\\n  formats, native formats of a number of CCD cameras, and uncompressed binary\\n  images in byte, short integer, and 4-byte real pixel format in 1- or 2-\\n  dimensions. The result of an image processing operation can be short integer\\n  or real pixels, or the same as that of the input image. MIRA does the\\n  operation using short or floating point arithmetic to maintain the precision\\n  and accuracy of the pixel format. Over 100 functions are hand-coded in\\n  assembly language for maximum speed on the Intel hardware.  The entire\\n  graphical interface is also written in assembly language to maximize\\n  the speed of windowing operations.  Windows for 2-d image and 1-d image/data\\n  display and analysis have dedicated cursors which read position and value\\n  value in real time as you move the mouse.  There are also smooth, real time\\n  contrast and brightness stretch and panning of a magnified portion of\\n  the displayed image(s), all operated by the mouse.

I tried to decide on paper what pixels go where, and failed.\\nHas anyone come up with method for mapping a planar to crosswise sheared\\nshape?\\n\\nCurrently I take:\\n\\n  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16\\n 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32\\n 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48\\n 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59 60 61 62 63 64\\n\\nand produce:\\n            \\n             1  2  3  4\\n33 34 35 36 17 18 19 20  5  6  7  8\\n49 50 51 52 37 38 39 40 21 22 23 24  9 10 11 12\\n            53 54 55 56 41 42 43 44 25 26 27 28 13 14 15 16\\n                        57 58 59 60 45 46 47 48 29 30 31 32\\n                                    61 62 63 64\\n\\nLine 1 follows the slope.

This is why there appears to\\nbe an optical illusion (ie. it appears to be either the inside or outside\\nof a cube, depending on your mood).  There are no vanishing points.\\nThis simplifies the drawing code for objects (which don\\'t have to\\nchange size as they move about in the room).  I\\'ve decided that this\\napproximation is alright, since small displacements at a large enough\\ndistance cause very little change in the apparent size of an object in\\na real perspective drawing.\\n\\nHopefully the \"context\" of the picture (ie. chairs on the floor, torches\\nhanging on the walls) will dispell any visual ambiguity.\\n\\nThanks in advance for any help.\\n\\n-- \\nTill next time,                \\\\o/   \\\\o/\\n                                V \\\\o/ V     email:pinky@tamu.edu\\n<>  Sam  Inala  <>                 V\\n\\n',\n",

Tommy Soderstrom will get credit for the shutout, but he barely broke\\na sweat until the third period as the FLYERS defense kept the Leafs from\\nmounting any serious attack.\\n\\nInjuries:\\n\\nPelle Eklund is day-to-day with a bruised thigh.\\n\\nRoster Moves:\\n\\nJason Bowen was added to the lineup for his first NHL game. Jason was the FLYERS\\nsecond pick in the first round (15th overall) of the 1992 entry draft. 19 years\\nold, 6\\'4\", 210 lbs. In 62 games with the tri-city Americans he had 10 goals,\\n12 assists and 219 PIM. He plays left wing and defense, he played defense in\\nthis game although Bobby Taylor said that Bill Dineen was planning to use him\\nup front as well.\\n\\nAndre Faust was returned to Hershey. He actually left after the second period\\nof the Kings game, flew to Albany, got the game tying goal in a Bears OT win,\\nand played again for Hershey Sunday night.\\n\\nLines:\\n\\nFedyk-Lindros-Recchi\\nBeranek-Brind\\'Amour-Dineen\\nLomakin-Butsayev-Conroy\\nActon-Brown\\n\\nGalley-McGill\\nYushkevich-Cronin\\nCarkner-Hawgood\\nBowen\\n\\nTommy Soderstrom in goal.\\n\\nActon replaced Lomakin in the 3rd period.\\n\\nGame Summary:\\n\\nIf the FLYERS played like this every night, they\\'d be in the playoffs this\\nyear. The FLYERS hit everything that moved. They created scoring chance after\\nscoring chance. They snuffed out everything that the Leafs tried to do.\\n\\nJason Bowen made a good play on his first NHL shift that almost created a goal.\\nHe had the puck in the top of the left offensive circle all alone, but instead\\nof taking the shot he found Brind\\'Amour crashing the net on the other side.\\nA perfect pass and a good shot across Daren Puppa\\'s body should have been a\\ngoal, but Puppa made a great save reading the play.\\n\\nGarry Galley gave the Maple Leafs 7th ranked power play the first chance when\\nhe hooked Doug Gilmour at 4:25. The FLYERS lowly 21st ranked penalty killing\\nunit was almost flawless the entire game, and set the tone on this kill. The\\nMaple Leafs got almost nothing but long unscreened shots, and the defense swept\\naway every rebound.\\n\\nAfter the power play, the FLYERS got a goal on an ugly play. Rod Brind\\'Amour\\ngave the puck to Greg Hawgood at the right point, and he sent a drive at the\\nnet. Puppa made the save and kicked the rebound right into the feet of Josef\\nBeranek and Bob Rouse, who were wrestling in the slot. Beranek was able to\\nget his stick on the puck and push it out to Dineen who was skating into\\nthe slot from the right circle, and he lifted a backhander over Puppa for\\na 1-0 FLYERS lead at 8:10.\\n\\nThe FLYERS kept the pressure on, and Puppa was the only Leaf keeping the FLYERS\\nfrom building on their lead for a while. Eventually things settled down and\\ndefense prevailed. Each team got an occasional scoring chance, but the goalies\\nwere strong. Bowen started giving some Lindros-like checks in his own corners.\\nThen Lindros, who was looking to avenge a hit Foligno gave him, thought he had\\na chance to even the score. He had Foligno lined up at center ice, leaned into\\nhim, and rode him into the center ice boards. The only problem was that Foligno\\nwas a little far from the boards, and Mike \"Mister\" McGeough felt that it\\nwarranted a boarding call at 15:38\\n\\nThe Leafs couldn\\'t get anything going on the power play as the FLYERS were\\nvery aggressive (for a change) on the kill.\\n\\nWith time running out in the period, Recchi carried through the neutral zone\\nand handed to Lindros as they approached the Leaf\\'s blue line. They were in\\na crowd with Wendell Clark and Jamie Macoun, Lindros tried a backhand pass\\nto Recchi through the feet of Macoun that connected to Recchi, but then Clark\\nchecked Recchi off the puck. Macoun then tried to clear, but it was weak and\\nwent right to McGill who had manned the point. He drove it from just inside\\nthe blue line. Macoun got his stick on it and deflected it past his own\\ngoalie at 19:55.1. Shots were 13-8 FLYERS in the period.\\n\\nThe FLYERS finally got their first chance on the power play when Dave Andreychuk\\ntripped up Rod Brind\\'Amour in his offensive zone. During the power play, the\\nFLYERS got cheated a little when the puck popped up into the air and Eric\\ngloved it down, but McGeough thought it hit his stick above his head. We\\ncould see from our seats at the other end of the ice that it only hit his glove\\nand the replay confirmed, but the faceoff went to the other end. As time was\\nrunning out in the advantage, Lindros found Galley with a pass across the goal\\nmouth but Puppa made the save. The rebound kicked back to the right corner where\\nRecchi picked it up, passed it out to Eric crashing through the right circle,\\nand Eric one-timed past Puppa at 7:55. With the assist, Recchi moves past\\nBobby Clarke\\'s 74-75 season, the second best one season total for a FLYER at\\n117.  Eric moves up to 4th all time in FLYERS rookie scoring with 67 points.\\n\\nMike Eastwood took down Al Conroy at 8:30 to give the FLYERS another chance on\\nthe power play. Not much pressure before Garry Galley ended the power play with\\na slash at 9:19. Not much happened on the 4 on 4, although the Leafs had most\\nof the possession. The FLYERS smothered the Leafs short power play. Tempers\\nflared a little at 13:14. Bowen and Pearson got roughing minors, Keith Acton\\ngot a bloody face. Dave McLlwain then took a dive and got Greg Hawgood a\\nhooking minor at 13:46 to set up a 4 on 3. The replay showed that Hawgood\\'s\\nstick stopped making contact with McLlwain long before he spun around and fell.\\nAgain the FLYERS smothered the Leafs power play, led by Dimitri Yushkevich.\\nBowen made a thundering hit when he came out of the box on Pearson. Berehowski\\ntried to perplex everybody with his sloooowball. He had the puck at the point,\\nand just trickled a pass down the slot. He made all the FLYERS look silly as\\nnobody could get a stick on it, and it got to Gilmour at the side of the net,\\nbut Soderstrom stoned him.\\n\\nThe FLYERS picked things up offensively after the kill was over, but didn\\'t\\nget anything home. Shots were 13-10 FLYERS.\\n\\nThe FLYERS were content with the 3 goal lead in the third period, and they\\ndecided that if Tommy wanted a shutout, he was going to have to work for it a\\nlittle.\\n\\nThe FLYERS got most of the scoring chances in the first 7 or so minutes of the\\nperiod, but couldn\\'t get past Puppa. Then the Leafs got tired of Lindros making\\nroad kill out of them, and tempers flared. 2 each for Doug Gilmour and Lindros \\n(unsportsmanlike conduct) and 2 each for Glenn Anderson and McGill (roughing)\\nall at 7:02. Terry Carkner then took a kneeing penalty at 7:51 on Gilmour.\\n\\nAgain the FLYERS smothered the Leafs power play.\\n\\nAt about the 12 minute mark, Dave Andreychuk got a shot away from his left\\ncircle that got through Soderstrom. The puck was rolling on it\\'s side, and\\nas luck would have it it turned away from the net instead of turning towards\\nit (think of how a rolling quarter inevitably starts to lean one way or the\\nother). Seconds later Rod Brind\\'Amour tripped up Gilmour at 12:24 to give the\\nLeafs another chance on the power play. On the advantage, after Soderstrom\\nstoned Andreychuk while lying down, Andreychuk got the rebound through\\nSoderstrom, but from behind the net and it went straight through and was swept\\naway by one of his defensemen. They kept the pressure on, but Soderstrom was\\nequal and preserved the shutout.\\n\\nRecchi cross checked Ken Baumgartner to get tempers hot and start a brawl\\nat 16:01. No punches thrown, Recchi got the initial minor, Krushelnyski\\nBaumgartner and Lindros each got roughing minors. At 17:02 Rouse and Beranek\\nexpressed their mutual dislike for each other and got 2 each for slashing to\\nset up another 4 on 4. Mike Eastwood shoved down Ryan McGill in the FLYERS\\nzone as they were battling for the puck, and while McGill was down he ran\\nhis stick across McGill\\'s face. The FLYERS were not happy with that at all.\\n5-8 Al Conroy paired up with 6-1 Berehowski, and started throwing punches.\\nUpward. Well, Al held his own, much to the delight of the crowd. Each got\\na couple punches in before going down in a head, and Al got a standing O!\\nPenalties: Eastwood 5 (cross check) + game, Clark, Carkner 10 each. Berehowski\\nand Conroy 5 each (fighting) at 17:49.\\n\\nSo a major penalty for the rest of the game for the FLYERS. The had no interest\\nin stting on the lead. Hawgood, Galley and Brind\\'Amour played catch until\\nHawgood found Dineen all alone in the left circle, he controlled the puck and\\nblasted it past Puppa at 18:39.\\n\\nThat was all the fireworks, Tommy Soderstrom would not face another shot. Puppa\\ndid, but kept the FLYERS off the board. 4-0 FLYERS, shots were 9-8 FLYERS in the\\n3rd. Probably the strongest game I\\'ve seen from the FLYERS since the All Star\\nbreak. Shutout number 4 for Soderstrom, all since 1/10. Tied for 2nd most in\\nthe NHL, but he\\'s played fewer games than Belfour (6) or the goalie I can\\'t\\nremember that he\\'s tied with.\\n\\nNext up it\\'s the Winnipeg Selannes Tuesday night in Winnipeg. The FLYERS cannot\\nbe eliminated if they win, but a loss coupled with an Islander win that night\\nin Washington would be the official end.\\n\\nFLYERS up to 71 points on the season in 78 games. Last year they had 75 points\\nin 80 games (5 under .500), so they need at least 8 points in their last 6\\ngames to improve on that only by percentage points (5 under in 84 is better\\nthan 5 under in 80).\\n\\nTragic number holds at 3 points with 6 games left. The tragic number for 5th\\nis 5 points, I watched the Rangers blow a 4-2 third period lead at home to\\nlose 5-4 before I finished this up. Why 5 points instead of 4? Well, the FLYERS\\nwill win the tie-breaker if they catch them, whereas the Islanders win tie\\nbreakers against the FLYERS and so need only a tie. The Rangers could crumble\\ndown the stretch as they play the Devils, the Pens twice, the FLYERS, and\\nfinish up with 2 games against the Caps. So I guess 5th place could be the\\ngoal for the team to focus on.\\n\\nFLYERS team record watch:\\n\\nEric Lindros:\\n\\n38 goals, 29 assists, 67 points\\n\\n(rookie records)\\nclub record goals:\\t\\t\\tclub record points:\\nEric Lindros\\t38 1992-93\\t\\tDave Poulin\\t76 1983-84\\nBrian Propp\\t34 1979-80\\t\\tBrian Propp\\t75 1979-80\\nRon Flockhart\\t33 1981-82\\t\\tRon Flockhart\\t72 1981-82\\nDave Poulin\\t31 1983-84\\t\\tEric Lindros\\t67 1992-93\\nBill Barber\\t30 1972-73\\t\\tPelle Eklund\\t66 1985-86\\n\\nMark Recchi:\\n\\n51 goals, 66 assists, 117 points.\\n\\nclub record goals:\\t\\t\\tclub record points:\\nReggie Leach\\t61 1975-76\\t\\tBobby Clarke\\t119 1975-76\\nTim Kerr\\t58 1985-86,86-87\\tMark Recchi\\t117 1992-93\\nTim Kerr\\t54 1983-84,84-85\\tBobby Clarke\\t116 1974-75\\nMark Recchi\\t51 1992-93\\t\\tBill Barber\\t112 1975-76\\nRick Macliesh\\t50 1972-73\\t\\tBobby Clarke\\t104 1972-73\\nBill Barber\\t50 1975-76\\t\\tRick Macliesh\\t100 1972-73\\nReggie Leach\\t50 1979-80\\n\\nFLYERS career years:\\n\\nPlayer\\t\\tPoints\\tBest Prior Season\\nMark Recchi\\t117\\t113 (90-91 Penguins)\\nRod Brind\\'Amour\\t79\\t77 (91-92 FLYERS)\\nGarry Galley\\t58\\t38 (84-85 Kings)\\nBrent Fedyk\\t58\\t35 (90-91 Red Wings)\\n\\nThat\\'s all for now...\\n\\npete clark jr - rsh FLYERS contact and mailing list owner\\n\\n',\n",

Sci., Urbana, IL\\nLines: 117\\n\\nDisclaimer -- This is for fun.\\n\\nIn my computerized baseball game, I keep track of a category called\\n\"stolen hits\", defined as a play made that \"an average fielder would not\\nmake with average effort.\"  Using the 1992 Defensive Averages posted\\nby Sherri Nichols (Thanks Sherri!), I\\'ve figured out some defensive stats\\nfor the second basemen. Hits Stolen have been redefined as \"Plays Kurt\\nStillwell would not have made.\"\\n\\nOK, I realize that\\'s unfair.  Kurt\\'s probably the victim of pitching staff,\\nfluke shots, and a monster park factor.  But let\\'s put it this way:  If we\\nreplaced every second baseman in the NL with someone with Kurt\\'s 57.6% out\\nmaking ability, how many extra hits would go by?\\n\\nTo try and correlate it to reality a little more, I\\'ve calculated Net\\nHits Stolen, based on the number of outs made compared to what a league\\naverage fielder would make.  By the same method I\\'ve calculated Net Double\\nPlays, and Net Extra Bases (doubles and triples let by).\\n\\nFinally, I throw all this into a a formula I call Defensive Contribution, or\\nDCON :->.  Basically, it represents the defensive contribution of a player.\\nI add this number to OPS to get DOPS (Defense + Onbase Plus Slug), which\\nshould represent the player\\'s total contribution to the team.  So don\\'t\\ntake it too seriously.  The formula for DCON appears at the end of this\\narticle.\\n\\nThe short version -- definition of terms\\nHS -- Hits Stolen -- Extra outs compared to Kurt Stillwell\\nNHS -- Net Hits Stolen -- Extra outs compared to average fielder\\nNDP -- Net Double Plays -- Extra double plays turned compared to avg fielder\\nNEB -- Net Extra Bases --  Extra bases prevented compared to avg. fielder\\nDCON -- Defensive Contribution -- bases and hits prevented, as a rate.\\nDOPS -- DCON + OPS -- quick & dirty measure of player\\'s total contribution.\\n\\nNational League\\n\\nname            HS   NHS   NDP   NEB   DCON    DOPS\\nAlicea, L.      50    21    2    -1    .160    .865\\nSandberg, R.   108    42    1     1    .134   1.015\\nThompson, R.    65    20    5    -1    .104    .852\\nLind, J.        66     8   -2     1    .027    .571\\nDoran, B.       31    -1    4     0    .014    .705\\nDeShields, D.   51     1   -2     1   -.002    .755\\nHarris, L.      25    -4    0     1   -.019    .602\\nLemke, M.       43    -1   -5    -5   -.038    .573\\nMorandini, M.   37    -9   -6     0   -.069    .580\\nRandolph, W.    13   -16    3    -1   -.088    .582\\nBiggio, C.      34   -26   -4     0   -.091    .656\\nStillwell, K.    0   -43   -3    -1   -.236    .336\\n\\nOrdered by DOPS\\n\\n1.015 Sandberg\\n .865 Alicea\\n .852 Thompson\\n .755 DeShields\\n .705 Doran\\n .678 *NL Average*\\n .656 Biggio\\n .602 Harris\\n .582 Randolph\\n .580 Morandini\\n .573 Lemke\\n .571 Lind\\n .336 Stillwell\\n\\nAmerican League\\n---------------\\n\\nname            HS   NHS   NDP   NEB   DCON    DOPS\\nFletcher, S.    59    18    5     1    .116    .811\\nReed, J.        83    17    3     1    .071    .708\\nRipken, B.      56     9   -1    -1    .044    .631\\nBaerga, C.      67     0   10     0    .029    .838\\nBlankenship, L. 34     2    2     1    .023    .757\\nMiller, K.      34    -4    1    -1   -.016    .725\\nAlomar, R.      62     4   -9    -2   -.020    .812\\nKnoblauch, C.   50   -13    7    -3   -.024    .718\\nBordick, M.     37    -4   -2    -1   -.025    .704\\nKelly, P.       42    -1   -5    -1   -.039    .636\\nWhitaker, L.    40    -8   -1    -2   -.041    .806\\nReynolds, H.    47    -6   -5     1   -.043    .603\\nSax, S.         56    -6   -9    -1   -.052    .555\\nSojo, L.        28   -11   -3     0   -.075    .602\\n\\nOrder by DOPS\\n\\n.838 Baerga\\n.812 Alomar\\n.811 Fletcher\\n.806 Whitaker\\n.757 Blankenship\\n.725 Miller\\n.718 Knoblauch\\n.708 Reed\\n.704 Bordick\\n.691 *AL Average*\\n.636 Kelly\\n.631 Ripken\\n.603 Reynolds\\n.602 Sojo\\n.555 Sax\\n\\nMore discussion --\\n\\nDCON formula:  ((NHS + NDP)/PA) + ((NHS + NDP + NEB)/AB)\\nWhy such a bizzare formula?

It does not go into\\ngreat detail, and is almost certainly not exhaustive.  Obviously, many\\nof the weaknesses are weaknesses of cryptographically secured mail in\\ngeneral, and will pertain to secure mail programs other than RIPEM.\\nIt is maintained by Marc VanHeyningen <mvanheyn@cs.indiana.edu>.  It\\nis posted monthly to a variety of news groups; followups pertaining\\nspecifically to RIPEM should go to alt.security.ripem.\\n\\nCRYPTANALYSIS ATTACKS\\n---------------------\\n\\n- Breaking RSA would allow an attacker to find out your private key,\\n  in which case he could read any mail encrypted to you and sign\\n  messages with your private key.\\n\\n  RSA is generally believed to be resistant to all standard\\n  cryptanalytic techniques.  Even a standard key (about 516 bits with\\n  RIPEM) is long enough to render this impractical, barring a\\n  huge investment in hardware or a breakthrough in factoring.\\n\\n- Breaking DES would allow an attacker to read any given message,\\n  since the message itself is encrypted with DES.  It would not allow\\n  an attacker to claim to be you.\\n\\n  DES has only 56 bits in its key, and thus could conceivably be\\n  compromised by brute force with sufficient hardware, but few agencies\\n  have such money to devote to simply read one message.  Since each\\n  message has a different DES key, the work for each message would\\n  remain high.\\n\\nKEY MANAGEMENT ATTACKS\\n----------------------\\n\\n- Stealing your private key would allow the same benefits as breaking\\n  RSA.  To safeguard it, it is encrypted with a DES key which is derived\\n  from a passphrase you type in.  However, if an attacker can get a copy\\n  of your private keyfile and your passphrase (by snooping network\\n  packets, tapping lines, or whatever) he could break the whole scheme.\\n\\n  The main risk is that of transferring either the passphrase or the\\n  private key file across an untrusted link.  So don\\'t do that.  Run \\n  RIPEM on a trusted machine, preferably one sitting right in front of\\n  you.  Ideally, your own machine in your own home (or maybe office)\\n  which nobody else has physical access to.\\n\\n- Fooling you into accepting a bogus public key for someone else could \\n  allow an opponent to deceive you into sending secret messages to him\\n  rather than to the real recipient.  If the enemy can fool your\\n  intended recipient as well, he could re-encrypt the messages with\\n  the other bogus public key and pass them along.\\n\\n  It is important to get the proper public keys of other people.\\n  The most common mechanism for this is finger; assuming the opponent\\n  has not compromised routers or daemons or such, finger can be \\n  given a fair amount of trust.  The strongest method of key\\n  authentication is to exchange keys in person; however, this is\\n  not always practical.  Having other people \"vouch for you\" by\\n  signing a statement containing your key is possible, although \\n  RIPEM doesn\\'t have features for doing this as automatically as\\n  PGP.  RIPEM does generate and check MD5 fingerprints of public keys\\n  in the key files; they may be exchanged via a separate channel for\\n  authentication.\\n\\nPLAYBACK ATTACKS\\n----------------\\n\\n- Even if an opponent cannot break the cryptography, an opponent could\\n  still cause difficulties.  For example, suppose you send a message\\n  with MIC-ONLY (a PEM mode which does not provide disclosure protection)\\n  to Alice which says \"OK, let\\'s do that.\" Your opponent intercepts\\n  it, and now resends it to Bob, who now has a message which is\\n  authenticated as from you telling him to do that.  Of course, he may\\n  interpret it in an entirely different context.  Or your opponent\\n  could transmit the same message to the same recipient much later,\\n  figuring it would be seen differently at a later time.  Or the\\n  opponent could change the Originator-Name: to himself, register \\n  your public key as his, and send a message hoping the recipient\\n  will send him return mail indicating (perhaps even quoting!) the\\n  unknown message.\\n\\n  To defeat playback attacks, the plaintext of each message should \\n  include some indication of the sender and recipient, and a unique\\n  identifier (typically the date).  A good front-end script for RIPEM\\n  should do this automatically (IMHO).  As a recipient, you should be\\n  sure that the Originator-Name: header and the sender indicated within\\n  the plaintext are the same, that you really are a recipient, and that\\n  the message is not an old one.  Some this also can and should be\\n  automated.  The author of this FAQ has made a modest attempt at\\n  automating the process of generating and checking encapsulated\\n  headers; the programs are included in the standard distribution in\\n  the utils directory.\\n\\nLOCAL ATTACKS\\n-------------\\n\\n- Clearly, the security of RIPEM cannot be greater than the security of\\n  the machine where the encryption is performed.  For example, under\\n  UNIX, a super-user could manage to get at your encrypted mail,\\n  although it would take some planning and effort to do something like\\n  replace the RIPEM executable with a Trojan horse or to get a copy of\\n  the plaintext, depending how it\\'s stored.\\n\\n  In addition, the link between you and the machine running RIPEM is\\n  an extension of that.  If you decrypt with RIPEM on a remote machine\\n  which you are connected to via network (or, worse yet, modem), an\\n  eavesdropper could see the plaintext (and probably also your\\n  passphrase.)\\n\\n  RIPEM should only be executed on systems you trust, obviously.  In\\n  the extreme case, RIPEM should only be used on your own machine,\\n  which you have total control over and which nobody else has access\\n  to, which has only carefully examined software known to be free of\\n  viruses, and so on.  However, there\\'s a very real trade-off between\\n  convenience and security here.\\n\\n  A more moderately cautious user might use RIPEM on a UNIX workstation\\n  where other people have access (even root access), but increase\\n  security by keeping private keys and the (statically linked, of\\n  course) executable on a floppy disk.\\n\\n  Some people will keep RIPEM on a multi-user system, but when dialing\\n  in over an insecure line, they will download the message to their\\n  own system and perform the RIPEM decryption there.  However, the\\n  security provided by such a mechanism is somewhat illusory; since\\n  you presumably type your cleartext password to log in, you\\'ve just\\n  given away the store, since the attacker can now log in as you and\\n  install traps in your account to steal your private key next time\\n  you use it from a less insecure line.  This will likely remain the\\n  situation as long as most systems use the rather quaint mechanism of\\n  cleartext password authentication.\\n\\n  I find it nice to put a brief statement of how carefully I manage my\\n  security arrangement in my .plan next to my public key, so that\\n  potential correspondents can be aware what level of precautions are\\n  in place.  Some people use two keys, a short one which is not\\n  carefully managed for ordinary use and a longer one which is treated\\n  with greater care for critical correspondence.\\n\\nUNTRUSTED PARTNER ATTACKS\\n-------------------------\\n\\n- RIPEM\\'s encryption will ensure that only a person with the private key\\n  corresponding to the public key used to encrypt the data may read the\\n  traffic.  However, once someone with that key gets the message, she\\n  may always make whatever kind of transformations she wishes.  There \\n  exist no cryptographic barriers to a recipient, say, taking an\\n  ENCRYPTED message and converting it to a MIC-ONLY message, signed by\\n  you and readable by anyone, although RIPEM does not provide this\\n  functionality.  Indeed, the latest PEM draft I have seen specifically\\n  states that such transformations should be possible to allow\\n  forwarding functions to work.\\n \\n  Including the recipients in the plaintext, as mentioned above, will\\n  make it possible for recipients of a redistributed message to be aware\\n  of its original nature.  Naturally, the security of the cryptography\\n  can never be greater than the security of the people using it.\\n',\n",

This color depth is NOT SUPPORTED\\n   with video BIOS version 1.00 and drivers version 1.01. A max of 65K\\n   colors are supported at 640x800 and 800x600 resolutions with 1MB\\n   VRAM.\\n\\n2) With the 65K color choice I notice two minor irritations:\\n\\n   a) Under NDW, when an entry in a list is highlighted (such as in an\\n      Open menu) and then is deselected, a faint vertical line often\\n      remains where the left edge of the highlighted rectangle used to\\n      be.\\n\\n   b) With Word for Windows, when you use shading in a table, the\\n      display shows the INVERSE of the shading; for example, if you\\n      shade the cell as 10%, the display is 90% (the printout is OK).\\n\\n3) The big killer bug is using the Borland C++ Integrated Development\\n   Environment. The problem occurs when you click on the Turbo Debugger\\n   icon (or use the Debugger option in the Run command), and the\\n   debugger application goes to VGA character mode (as it is designed\\n   to do). The screen goes haywire, and is largely unreadable. The\\n   Turbo Debugger display is all garbled.\\n\\n   Through trial and error, I have found that when the disrupted screen\\n   is displayed you should do [Alt-Spacebar] followed by the letter\\n   \"R\".

That's especially true for\\nsci.crypt.  For that matter, I've created alt.privacy.clipper, since\\nthe traffic is appearing in *many* different groups right now.\\n\\nI'm going to focus here on some technical aspects of the plan, hence my\\nfollowup to sci.crypt.  Frankly, if you're not an absolutist, your\\nfeelings may turn on some of these issues.  For example -- with an\\n80-bit key, simply splitting it into two 40-bit pieces is much less\\nacceptable than other schemes, because it means that if just one\\nrepository is, shall we say, overly pliable, a would-be eavesdropper\\nwould need to recover just 40 more bits of key.  I need not point out\\nin this newsgroup that that's pretty easy to do by exhaustive search.\\nA slightly more complex scheme -- XOR-ing the key with a random number,\\nand then with its complement -- would produce two 80-bit subkeys,\\nneither of which is useful alone.  That variant is much more resistant\\nto attack.  Clearly, one can get even more sophisticated, to protect\\nthe subkeys even more.\\n\\nOther thoughts...  Some people have noted the size and complexity of\\nthe databases necessary.  But the id strings the phones emit could be\\ntheir back door key, double-encrypted with the escrow repositories'\\npublic keys.  For that matter, they could do that only with session\\nkeys, and have no back door at all.  In that case, the FBI would have\\nto bring every intercept to the repositories to be decrypted.  This\\nwould answer many of the objections along the lines of ``how do you\\nmake sure they stop''.\\n\\nWe can even combine that with a variant of the digital telephony back\\ndoor -- have the switch do the tap, but with a digitally-signed record\\nof the time, phone number, etc, of the call.  That provides proof to\\nthe escrow agents that the tap was done in compliance with the terms of\\nthe warrant.\\n\\nI can suggest other variations, too.  Suppose each Clipper chip had 100\\npublic key pairs.  Each would be used ~10 times, after which you'd need\\nmore keying material.  (Not a bad idea in any event.)  This could be\\nused to enforce time limits, or rather, usage limits, on each warrant;\\nthe keys the repository agents would deliver wouldn't last for very\\nlong.\\n\\nI suspect that the cryptographic algorithm itself is secure.  Apart from\\nthe obvious -- why push a weak algorithm when you've already got the\\nback door? -- I think that the government is still genuinely concerned\\nabout foreign espionage, especially aimed at commercial targets.  This\\nscheme lets the spooks have their cake and eat it, too.  (I've heard\\nrumors, over the years, that some factions within NSA were unhappy with\\nDES because it was too good.  Not that they couldn't crack it, but it\\nwas much too expensive to do so as easily as they'd want.)  They're keeping\\nthe details secret so that others don't build their own implementations\\nwithout the back door.\\n\\nThe cryptographic protocol, though, is another matter.  I see no valid\\nreasons for keeping it secret, and -- as I hope I've shown above -- there\\nare a lot of ways to do things that aren't (quite) as bad.\\n\",\n",

Please feel free to distribute this and my other messages\\non Clipper.\\n\\nThe name of the encryption algorithm is \"Skipjack.\"\\n\\nMartin Hellman had written\\n\\n                and the serial number of the unit added to produce a three part\\n                message which will then be encrypted under the system key SK\\n                producing\\n\\n                     E{ E[M; K], E[K; UK], serial number;  SK}\\n\\nTo which I responded:\\n\\n        My understanding is that E[M; K] is not encrypted under SK (called the\\n        \"family key\") and that the decrypt key corresponding to SK is held by\\n        law enforcement.  Does anyone have first hand knowledge on this?\\n\\nI was correct in that E[M; K] is not encrypted under SK.  However, Skipjack\\nbeing a single-key system, there is, of course, not a separate decrypt key\\nfor the family key SK.\\n\\n        The unit key, also called the \"chip key,\" is generated from the\\n        serial number N as follows.  Let N1, N2, and N3 be 64 bit blocks\\n        derived from N, and let S1 and S2 be two 80-bit seeds used as keys.\\n        Compute the 64-bit block\\n\\n                R1 = E[D[E[N1; S1]; S2]; S1]\\n\\n        (Note that this is like using the DES in triple encryption mode with\\n        two keys.)  Similarly compute blocks R2 and R3 starting with N2 and N3.\\n        (I\\'m unlear about whether the keys S1 and S2 change.  The fact that\\n        they\\'re called seeds suggests they might.)  Then R1, R2, and R3 are\\n        concatenated together giving 192 bits.  The first 80 bits  form K1 and\\n        the next 80 bits form K2.  The remaining bits are discarded.\\n\\nThe seeds S1 and S2 do not change.   The whole process is performed on\\na laptop computer, and S1 and S2 are supplied by two independent people\\nso that no one person knows both.  The same S1 and S2 are used during\\nan entire \"programming session\" to generate keys for a stream of serial\\nnumbers.  Everything is discarded at the end (the computer could be\\nthrown out if desired).\\n\\nThe serial number is 30 bits and the values N1, N2, and N3 are formed\\nby padding the serial number with fixed 34-bit blocks (separate padding\\nfor each value).\\n\\nThe resulting keys K1 and K2 are output onto separate floppy disks, paired\\nup with their serial number.  Each pair is stored in a separate file.  The\\nfloppy disks are taken away by two separate people on behalf of the two\\nescrow agencies.\\n\\nDorothy Denning\\ndenning@cs.georgetown.edu\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------\\nI am sure more technical detail will be known when time goes by.\\nPlease remark, that in posting this, I do not automatically agree\\nwith it\\'s contents and implications.

Sophisticated\\nencryption can have this effect in the United States.  When\\nexported abroad, it can be used to thwart foreign intelligence\\nactivities critical to our national interests.  In the past, it has\\nbeen possible to preserve a government capability to conduct\\nelectronic surveillance in furtherance of legitimate law\\nenforcement and national security interests, while at the same time\\nprotecting the privacy and civil liberties of all citizens.  As\\nencryption technology improves, doing so will require new,\\ninnovative approaches.\\n\\nIn the area of communications encryption, the U. S. Government has\\ndeveloped a microcircuit that not only provides privacy through\\nencryption that is substantially more robust than the current\\ngovernment standard, but also permits escrowing of the keys needed\\nto unlock the encryption.  The system for the escrowing of keys\\nwill allow the government to gain access to encrypted information\\nonly with appropriate legal authorization.\\n\\nTo assist law enforcement and other government agencies to collect\\nand decrypt, under legal authority, electronically transmitted\\ninformation, I hereby direct the following action to be taken:\\n\\nINSTALLATION OF GOVERNMENT-DEVELOPED MICROCIRCUITS\\n\\nThe Attorney General of the United States, or her representative,\\nshall request manufacturers of communications hardware which\\nincorporates encryption to install the U.S. government-developed\\nkey-escrow microcircuits in their products.  The fact of law\\nenforcement access to the escrowed keys will not be concealed from\\nthe American public.  All appropriate steps shall be taken to\\nensure that any existing or future versions of the key-escrow\\nmicrocircuit are made widely available to U.S. communications\\nhardware manufacturers, consistent with the need to ensure the\\nsecurity of the key-escrow system.  In making this decision, I do\\nnot intend to prevent the private sector from developing, or the\\ngovernment from approving, other microcircuits or algorithms that\\nare equally effective in assuring both privacy and a secure key-\\nescrow system.\\n\\nKEY-ESCROW\\n\\nThe Attorney General shall make all arrangements with appropriate\\nentities to hold the keys for the key-escrow microcircuits\\ninstalled in communications equipment.  In each case, the key\\nholder must agree to strict security procedures to prevent\\nunauthorized release of the keys.  The keys shall be released only\\nto government agencies that have established their authority to\\nacquire the content of those communications that have been\\nencrypted by devices containing the microcircuits.  The Attorney\\nGeneral shall review for legal sufficiency the procedures by which\\nan agency establishes its authority to acquire the content of such\\ncommunications.\\n\\nPROCUREMENT AND USE OF ENCRYPTION DEVICES\\n\\nThe Secretary of Commerce, in consultation with other appropriate\\nU.S. agencies, shall initiate a process to write standards to\\nfacilitate the procurement and use of encryption devices fitted\\nwith key-escrow microcircuits in federal communications systems\\nthat process sensitive but unclassified information.

Well, I now have the\\nopportunity to write some font rendering software so I would like to have\\nsome of my questions answered before I jump into the deep end.\\n\\nThe main problem I face is how to use the even/odd or non-winding rules to\\nturn the outlines into a single outline polygon (my renderer can handle\\ncomplex polygons so there is no need to reduce the polygons to simple\\npolygons). For example, in the letter \"O\" there are two outlines:\\n\\n\\t1) The outside outline which is clockwise (TrueType font)\\n\\t2) The inside outline which is counterclockwise.\\n\\nOne common solution used by a number of rendering packages is to simply \\nconnect the inner outline to the outer outline at the point where the\\ntwo outlines are closest. This is equivalent to descibing a \"polygon with\\nholes\". The renderer will then make the appropriate hole since the interior\\npolygon edges are in the opposite direction to the outside edges.\\n\\nI do not want to use this simplistic system since:\\n\\n\\t1) It will not handle all outline fonts properly (it is not a simple\\n\\t\\tmatter to connect the outer outline to the inner outline for\\n\\t\\tsome fancy fonts).\\n\\t2) It does not properly handle the even/odd or non-winding rules.\\n\\nFrom my research over the years the proper solution is to use a trapezoid\\ndecomposition algorithm to scan convert the outlines into trapezoids (as\\nis done by the Postscript and TrueType font rasterizers). These trapezoidal\\npolygons can then be easily and properly rendered by the 3D scanline renderer.\\n\\nMy question is: are there any better solutions to turning the outlines into\\npolgyons other than the trapezoid decomposer? I am not fond of this solution\\nsince it creates excess number of polygons.\\n\\nAnother question, for those in the know: what is the best algorithm to create\\nbevelled and/or offset curves for font outlines? I have a dozen papers on these\\nsubjects but I can\\'t tell which method is the best to implement.\\n\\nThanks for any pointers.\\n\\n--> Rob Lansdale\\n\\n-- \\nRobert Lansdale - (416) 978-6619       Dynamic Graphics Project\\t\\nInternet: lansd@dgp.toronto.edu        Computer Systems Research Institute\\nUUCP:   ..!uunet!dgp.toronto.edu!lansd University of Toronto\\nBitnet:\\t  lansd@dgp.utoronto           Toronto, Ontario M5S 1A4, CANADA\\n',\n",

Where can i connect a 3 1/2\" AMP-Connector\\n>to supply my 3 1/2\" HD?\\n\\nIt is very possible to connect another internal hard disk in any\\nmacintosh if you can find the space to put it. I have a IIsi that came\\nwith a Quantum 80 meg drive. When I ran into space problems, I slapped in\\nanother 40 meg quantum that I had sitting on a shelf. Here is what I did.\\n \\nFirst off, I was concerned about space. Since both drives are Quantum\\nquarter height drives, I finally decided that the logical place for them\\nwas stacked one upon the other. Fine, they fit snugly. (I have not had a\\nproblem with heat yet, and these drives have been running together for\\nover two months.\\n\\nThe next problem was connecting the drive. If you have a spare internal\\nhard disk power cable as I did, then half of your troubles are over. just\\nsplice in the extra cable so that you get one square motherboard\\nconnector and two hard disk power connectors. If you don\\'t have a spare\\ncable, you will have to buy the wires and connectors which can be found\\nin any good electronics store for about $10. I would suggest properly\\nsoldering/heatshrinking the connections to reduce the possibility of\\nshorts or bad connections.\\n\\nNext, you need a ribbon cable connection. Again, I had a spare hard disk\\nribbon cable, and I wanted to be careful in case this didn\\'t word so what\\nI did was purchase a crimp on 50 pin cable connector that gave me another\\nmale connector in the middle of my spare cable. The part cost $10 again,\\nand is easily attached with any good wood vice. The theory behind using a\\ncrimp on connector is that if this doesn\\'t work, my original cable is not\\ndamaged, and I can go back to the original setup.\\n\\nHaving done all that, I couldn\\'t be bothered to check the dev notes for\\npower consumption so I plugged it in and it works like a charm to this\\nday. \\n\\nIn a mac II, everything should work the same. Be careful with the ID\\'s of\\nthe drive, and ensure that the terminating resistors on both drives are\\nintact. I did not try this without the terminating resistors but it\\nseemed logical that if I am splitting the SCSI chain, that the signal\\nshould be terminated at all the ends.\\n\\nLet me know if you have any more questions.\\n\\nPeter Hansen\\nBell Northern Research\\npgmoffc@BNR.ca\\n',\n",

Since they aren\\'t fixed in position on their\\nstainless steel pins, you might try sliding them into a slightly different\\nposition. On my PowerBook 100, I can slide them almost completely out of\\ncontact with the trackball. In fact, one of the notes from sumex on fixing\\nthe trackball advocates sliding the roller so that its _edge_ contacts the\\nball, not the center cylindrical area.\\n\\nI\\'ve done this with my PB100, and it does seem to improve the feel, but\\nneeds to be adjusted from time to time. I just popped open one of our\\noffice\\'s PB170s, and while there isn\\'t as much latitude for movement, one\\ncould still adjust the roller slightly. If your PB140 is the same it might\\nhelp.\\n\\nI would suspect the most likely culprit to be a slippery blue roller. If\\nyou can take it out, clean it with a mild soapy solution, or isopropyl \\nalcohol. Also, be sure the ball is grease-free.\\n\\nIf you drop the ball in minus the retaining ring, roll the ball and see\\nif it is actually causing the axle to spin. \\n\\nIf all this still doesn\\'t solve it, then maybe a new one is in order. :-(\\nIt could be an electrical connection, in which case replacement would be\\nnecessary. But my experience with both mice and trackballs has been that\\ndirt has been the normal problem, not an electrical malfunction.\\n\\nHope this helps,\\n\\nMurray\\n \\n\\n-- \\nMurray M.

It is possible to objectively\\ndetermine someone\\'s guilt or innocence within an non-inherent system.\\nI agree that morality is not necessarily inherent (unless you state that\\neverything we do has an evolutionary basis), but this does not mean that\\nit cannot be objective in theory.\\n\\n>This \"natural morality\" is not an objective system, as evidenced by\\n>your comments about lions, and mine.\\n\\nPerhaps it can be objective, but not inherent.  Anyway, as I noted before,\\nthe practices related to mating rituals, etc. among the animals are likely\\nthe only ones to be considered \"immoral\" under the previous \"definitions\"\\nof the natural law.  Therefore, some revisions are in order, since the\\nclass of activities surrounding mating seem to pose some general problems.\\n\\n>>And in fact, the only way that the postulates could be determined by an\\n>>outsider would be if there were some sort of higher truth, like some\\n>>sort of god or something.  But, I do not think that a god is necessary\\n>>for an objective system, while it seems that you do.\\n>What are you trying to say here?\\n\\nIt seens that you are objecting to the notion of an objective system\\nbecause perhaps you think that it would imply inherence, which would\\nnecessitate some sort of grand design?\\n\\n>>No, I have classified behavior of most animals as in line with a\\n>>moral system.

Perhaps they are not intelligent enough to be\\n>>immoral.\\n>And perhaps it\\'s because you have yet to define a \"moral\" system.\\n\\nI think I have.  It is a code of ethics which basically defines undesired\\nbehaviors, etc.  An immoral behavior could be unwanted, unproductive,\\nor destructive, etc., depending on the goal of the system (that is,\\nimmoral to what end?).\\n\\nkeith\\n',\n",

Below is a very short\\ndescription of the process which we use; if you have further questions,\\nfeel free to poke me via e-mail.\\n\\n================================================================\\n*ASSUME: locally smooth distortion\\n\\n0) Compute the Delaunay Triangulation of your (x,y) points.  This\\n   defines the set of neighbors for each point.  If your data are\\n   not naturally convex, you may have very long edges on the convex hull.\\n   Consider deleting these edges.\\n\\n1) Now, there are two goals:\\n\\n    a) move the DistortedData(x,y) to the Reference(x,y)\\n    b) keep the Length(e) (as measured from the current (x,y)\\'s)\\n       as close as possible to the DigitizedLength(e) (as measured \\n       using the digitized (x,y)\\'s).\\n\\n2) For every point, compute a displacement based on a) and b).  For\\n   example:\\n\\n    a) For (x,y) points for which you know the Reference(x,y), you\\n       can move alpha0*(Reference(x,y) - Current(x,y)).   This will\\n       slowly move the DistortedReference(x,y) towards the\\n       Reference(x,y). \\n    b) For all other points, examine the current length of each edge.\\n       For each edge, compute a displacement which would make that edge\\n       the correct length (where \"correct\" is the DigitizedLength). \\n       Take the vector sum of these edge displacements, and move the\\n       point alpha1*SumOfEdgeDisplacements.  This will keep the\\n       triangulated mesh consistent with your Digitized mesh.\\n\\n3) Iterate 2) until you are happy (for example, no point moves very much).\\n\\nalpha0 and alpha1 need to be determined by experimentation.   Consider\\nhow much you believe the Reference(x,y) - i.e., do you absolutely insist\\non the final points exactly matching the References, or do you want to\\nbalance some error in matching the Reference against changes in length\\nof the edges.\\n\\nWARNING: there are a couple of geometric invariants which must be\\nobserved (essentially, you can\\'t allow the convex hull to change, and\\nyou can\\'t allow triangles to \"fold over\" neighboring triangles.  Both of\\nthese can be handled either by special case checks on the motion of\\nindividual points, or by periodically re-triangulating the points (using \\nthe current positions - but still calculating DigitizedLength from the\\noriginal positions.  When we first did this, the triangulation time was\\nprohibitive, so we only did it once.  If I were motivated to try and\\nchange code that has been working in production mode for 5 years, I\\n*might* go back and re-triangulate on every iteration.

I am \\nusing X11R4 and Motif 1.1 currently, although I will also be \\nworking with Open Look in the future.\\n\\n     What I need to do is under certain circumstances prevent the \\nuser from switching from one window of the application to \\nanother window.  Let's say, for example, that Window A is on top \\nof Window B in the window hierarchy.  Normally, if the user clicks \\nthe mouse in Window B it will be brought to the top of the \\nwindow hierarchy and placed on top of Window A.  Under certain \\ncircumstances if the user clicks the mouse in Window B I need to \\nbeep and prevent Window B from being raised on top of Window \\nA.\\n\\n      From the research and testing I've done so far, it appears that \\nthis window ordering is handled by the window manager, in this \\ncase Motif.  I haven't found any way to override this default \\nprocessing through standard X Window functions.  I can tell \\nwhen this switching occurs through focus change and mapping \\nnotify events, but I can't find any way to tell Motif not to make the \\nswitch.\\n\\n      The temporary solution I've currently come up with is very \\nkludgy but it partially works.  When I detect such a window switch \\nin those cases when the switch is not allowed, I manually force \\nthe formerly top window back on top with an XRaiseWindow call \\nand beep with the XBell function.  This provides the necessary \\nfunctionality but looks ugly when the windows switch places \\ntwice.\\n\\n      Does anyone know how I can tell Motif (or preferably *any* \\nwindow manager) when I don't want the window order switch to \\nactually take place?  Respond either by e-mail or posting to this \\nnewsgroup.\\n\\nCheers....

This is a second RFD, replacing\\nthe one originally posted in January \\'93 (and never taken to a vote).  The\\nproposed groups are described below:\\n\\nNAME: \\t comp.os.ms-windows.nt.setup\\nSTATUS:  Unmoderated.\\nPURPOSE: Discussions about setting up and installing Windows NT, and about\\n\\t system and peripheral compatability issues for Windows NT.\\n\\nNAME:\\t comp.os.ms-windows.nt.misc\\nSTATUS:\\t Unmoderated.\\nPURPOSE: Miscellaneous non-programming discussions about using Windows NT,\\n\\t including issues such as security, networking features, console\\n\\t mode and Windows 3.1 (Win16) compatability.\\n\\nRATIONALE:\\n\\tMicrosoft NT is the newest member of the Microsoft Windows family\\n\\tof operating systems (or operating environments for those who wish\\n\\tto argue about the meaning of an \"OS\").  The family ranges from\\n\\tModular Windows through Windows 3.1 and Windows for Workgroups to\\n\\tWindows NT at the high end.  To date, Microsoft has shipped over\\n\\t50,000 beta copies and pre-release SDKs of Windows NT -- the\\n\\tactual release is slated for May/June \\'93.\\n\\n\\tWhile Windows NT has an entirely new design internally, it shares\\n\\tan application programming interface with the other members of the\\n\\tWindows family; its Win32 API includes the Win16 API used in Win-\\n\\tdows 3.1, and the Win32s API subset (Win32 less threads, networking\\n\\tand security) can be used to create 32-bit applications for\\n\\tWindows 3.1.\\n\\n\\tThe user interface is also practically identical to that of Windows\\n\\t3.1, with the addition of logins and a few other features.  It uses\\n\\tProgram Manager, File Manager and other applets, and generally pre-\\n\\tsents an identical appearance to the user.  Many of the announced\\n\\tWindows NT applications are ports of existing Windows 3.1 apps, and\\n\\tNT also runs existing 3.1 applications.\\n\\n\\tThus, it appears logical that Windows NT should share the following\\n\\tgroups with the other members of the Windows family:\\n\\t\\tcomp.os.ms-windows.apps\\n\\t\\tcomp.os.ms-windows.programmer.tools\\n\\t\\tcomp.os.ms-windows.programmer.misc\\n\\t\\tcomp.os.ms-windows.programmer.win32\\n\\t\\n\\tThe following groups are also clearly applicable to Windows NT as\\n\\twell as Windows 3.1:\\n\\t\\tcomp.os.ms-windows.announce\\n\\t\\tcomp.os.ms-windows.advocacy\\n\\t\\n\\tIn conclusion, the only clear argument for the separation of the\\n\\tWindows 3.1 and Windows NT hierarchies is different internal\\n\\tstructures of Windows 3.1 and Windows NT.  And yet operating\\n\\tsystems such as OS/2, Macintosh OS, Xenix and Coherent all have\\n\\tundergone major rewrites without having been split into separate\\n\\tnewsgroup hierarchies.\\n\\n\\tFurther, Windows 3.1 is due for a major rewrite itself in 1994 --\\n\\twhen the fully 32-bit, protected-mode and with-DOS-built-in next-\\n\\tgeneration Windows, \"Chicago\", debuts next year, surely it should\\n\\tremain in the same hierarchy.

I would rather have the untried\\nrookie with great minor league numbers than the veteran who has proven\\nhimself to be average at best. I don\\'t care if he is 15; if he plays\\nbetter than what I have, I want him out there. Sandy Alomar had decent\\nminor league numbers, grossly inflated by the PCL in general and Las\\nVegas in particular; he should have been projected as an average major\\nleague hitter (which is good for a catcher, I\\'ll admit). Santiago\\'s\\nnumbers would probably come out the same as Sandy\\'s, but I don\\'t have\\nthe league data from the mid-80s to check it out.\\n\\nThat being said, I agree with sending Lopez to Richmond, at least to\\nstart the season. As the box below shows, he has *one* minor league\\nseason in which he hit well. He has two in which he hit very, very\\npoorly. I want to see that the 92 Lopez is real. Olson and Berryhill\\nare not complete mediocrities; for catchers, especially NL catchers,\\nthey are essentially average hitters, with equivalent averages around\\n.220. If he had hit well at prior levels, I would say he belongs on\\nthe Braves; but there is a reasonable chance that Lopez last year was\\njust as much a fluke as Alomar in 90 or Santiago in 87.

It is not bad error to program a program for 8bit images only\\nat that time, but when 24bit image formats are included to program the\\nwhole design should be changed to support 24bit images.\\nThat were not done and now we have\\n -the program violate jpeg design (and any 24bit image format)\\n -the program has human interface errors.\\n\\nOtherway is to drop saving images as jpegs or any 24bit format without\\nclearly saying that it is special case and not expected in normal use.\\n\\n[ ..deleted.. ]\\n\\n==clip==\\n\\nSome new items follows.\\n\\n==clip==\\n\\nI have seen that XV quantizes the image sometimes poorly with -best24\\noption than with default option we have.\\nThe reason surely is the quantizer used as -best24; it is (surprise)\\nthe same than used in ppmquant.\\n\\nIf you remember, I have tested some quantizers. In that test I found\\nthat rlequant (with default) is best, then comes djpeg, fbmquant, xv\\n(our default) in that order.

It is very annoying when you have waited image to come about\\nfive minutes and then it is gone away immediately.\\nThe buffer should be cleaned when the image is complete.\\n\\nAlso, good idea is to wait few seconds before activating keyboard\\nand mouse for XV after the image is completed.\\nOften it happens that image pops to the screen quickly, just when\\nI'm writing something with editor or such. Those key pressings\\nthen go to XV and image has gone or something weird.\\n\\nIn the color editor, when I turn a color meter and release it, XV\\nupdates the images.

Lewis (faq%craft@uunet.uu.net) maintains the informative and\\n  well written \"comp.windows.x Frequently Asked Questions\" document.\\n  Its focus is on general X information, while this FAQ concentrates\\n  on performance.\\n\\n  The comp.windows.x FAQ does address the issue of speed, but only with\\n  regards to the X server.  The gist of that topic seems to be:\\n\\t\"Use X11R5, it is faster than R4\".\\n  (Please see the X FAQ for complete details).\\n\\n---------------\\nWindow Managers\\n---------------\\n\\n  There are a lot of window managers out there, with lots of different\\n  features and abilities.  The choice of which to use is by necessity a\\n  balancing act between performance and useful features.  At this\\n  point, most respondents have agreed upon \"twm\" as the best candidate\\n  for a speedy window manager. \\n\\n  A couple of generic tricks you can try to soup up your window manger,\\n  is turning off unnecessary things like \"zooming\" and \"opaque move\".\\n  Also, if you lay out your windows in a tiled manner, you reduce the\\n  amount of cpu power spent in raising and lowering overlapping\\n  windows.                           Joe English (joe@trystero.art.com)\\n\\n  I\\'ve found that a good font for tiling is 7x13 (aka:\\n  -misc-fixed-medium-r-normal--13-100-100-100-c-70-iso8859-1 ). It is\\n  the biggest font I know of that I can use on my Sun (1152x900 screen)\\n  and still get two 80 column terminal windows side-by-side on the\\n  display with no overlap.  Other font suggestions will be accepted.\\n\\n------------\\nThe X Server\\n------------\\n\\nWhich Server?\\n- - - - - - -\\n  Make sure that your server is a proper match for your hardware.\\n  If you have a monochrome monitor, use a monochrome X11 server.\\n\\n  On my Monochrome Sun, I haven\\'t noticed much difference between\\n  the Xsun (colour) server and XsunMono, however it was pointed out to\\n  me that XsunMono is about 800k smaller and therefore should contribute\\n  to less paging.  \\n         [ thanks to: Jonny Farringdon (j.farringdon@psychol.ucl.ac.uk),\\n                        Michael Salmon (Michael.Salmon@eos.ericsson.se) ]\\n\\n  How your server was compiled can also make a difference.  Jeff Law\\n  (law@schirf.cs.utah.edu) advises us that on a Sun system, X should be\\n  compiled with gcc (version 2.*) or with the unbundled Sun compiler.\\n  You can expect to get \"*very* large speedups in the server\" by not\\n  using the bundled SunOS compiler.  I assume that similar results\\n  would occur if you used one of the other high-quality commercial\\n  compilers on the market.\\n\\nLocking the Server into RAM?\\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\\n  Has anyone tried hacking the X server so that it is locked into RAM and\\n  does not get paged?  eg: via a call to plock().  Does this help\\n  performance at all?  I\\'ve had one inquiry on this topic, and a few\\n  pointers to the plock() function call, but no hard evidence from someone\\n  who\\'s tried it.  I am not in a position to give it a try.  \\n\\t\\t\\t  [thanks to: Eric C Claeys (ecc@eperm.att.com),\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t      Danny Backx (db@sunbim.be),\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t      Juan D. Martin (juando@cnm.us.es) ]\\nStarting your Server\\n- - - - - - - - - - -\\n  Joe English (joe@trystero.art.com) :\\n    If you start up a lot of clients in your .xsession or whatever, sleep\\n    for a second or two after launching each one.  After I changed my\\n    .xclients script to do this, logging in actually took *less* time...\\n    we have a heavily loaded system without much core, though.\\n\\n  This sounds crazy, but I have confirmed that it works!  \\n\\n  Warner Losh (imp@Solbourne.COM) provided me with a good explanation of\\n  why this works, which I have summarized here:\\n\\n    When you start up an X server it takes a huge amount of time to\\n    start accepting connections.  A lot of initialization is done by\\n    the server when it starts.  This process touches a large number of\\n    pages.  Any other process running at the same time would fight the\\n    server for use of the CPU, and more importantly, memory.  If you\\n    put a sleep in there, you give the Server a chance to get itself\\n    sorted out before the clients start up.\\n\\n    Similarly, there is also a lot of initialization whenever an X\\n    client program starts: toolkits registering widgets, resources\\n    being fetched, programs initializing state and \"databases\" and so\\n    forth.  All this activity is typically memory intensive.  Once this\\n    initialization is done (\"The process has reached a steady state\"),\\n    the memory usage typically settles down to using only a few pages.\\n    By using sleeps to stagger the launching of your clients in your\\n    .Xinitrc , you avoid them fighting each other for your\\n    workstation\\'s limited resources\\n\\n  This is most definitely a \"Your Mileage May Vary\" situation, as there\\n  are so many variables to be considered: available RAM, local swap\\n  space, load average, number of users on your system, which clients\\n  you are starting, etc.\\n\\n  Currently in my .xinitrc I have a situation like:\\n\\t(sleep 1; exec xclock ) &\\n\\t(sleep 1; exec xbiff ) &\\n\\t(sleep 1; exec xterm ) &\\n\\t(sleep 1; exec xterm ) &\\n\\n  I\\'ve experimented with:\\n\\t(sleep 1; exec xclock ) &\\n\\t(sleep 2; exec xbiff ) &\\n\\t(sleep 3; exec xterm ) &\\n\\t(sleep 4; exec xterm ) &\\n\\n  I\\'ve even tried:\\n\\t(sleep 2; exec start_X_clients_script ) &\\n  and then in start_X_clients_script I had:\\n\\t(sleep 1; exec xclock ) &\\n\\t(sleep 1; exec xbiff ) &\\n\\t(sleep 1; exec xterm ) &\\n\\t(sleep 1; exec xterm ) &\\n\\n    [ The idea with this last one was to make sure that xinit had\\n    completely finished processing my .xinitrc, and had settled down\\n    into a \"steady state\" before the sleep expired and all my clients\\n    were launched. ]\\n\\n  All of these yielded fairly comparable results, and so I just stuck with\\n  my current setup, for its simplicity.  You will probably have to\\n  experiment a bit to find a setup which suits you.\\n\\nFonts\\n- - -\\n  Loading fonts takes time and RAM.  If you minimize the number of fonts\\n  your applications use, you\\'ll get speed increases in load-up time.\\n\\n  One simple strategy is to choose a small number of fonts (one small, one\\n  large, one roman, whatever suits you) and configure all your clients -- or\\n  at least all your heavily used clients -- to use only those few fonts.\\n  Client programs should start up quicker if their font is already loaded\\n  into the server.  This will also conserve server resources, since fewer\\n  fonts will be loaded by the server.\\n\\t\\t\\t      [ Farrell McKay (fbm@ptcburp.ptcbu.oz.au),\\n\\t\\t\\t        Joe English (joe@trystero.art.com) ]\\n\\n  eg: My main xterm font is 7x13, so I also have twm set up to use 7x13\\n  in all it\\'s menus and icons etc.  Twm\\'s default font is 8x13.  Since\\n  I don\\'t normally use 8x13, I\\'ve eliminated one font from my server.\\n\\n  Oliver Jones (oj@roadrunner.pictel.com):\\n    Keep fonts local to the workstation, rather than loading them over nfs.\\n    If you will make extensive use of R5 scalable fonts, use a font server.\\n\\nAbout the Resources File\\n- - - - - - - - - - - - -\\n\\n    Keep your .Xresources / .Xdefaults file small.  Saves RAM and saves\\n    on server startup time.          Joe English (joe@trystero.art.com)\\n\\n  One suggestion:\\n\\n    In your .Xdefaults (.Xresources) file, try putting only the minimum\\n    number of resources that you want to have available to all of your\\n    applications.  For example:  *reverseVideo: true\\n\\n    Then, separate your resources into individual client-specific\\n    resource files.  For example: $HOME/lib/app-defaults.  In your\\n    .login file set the environment variable XUSERFILESEARCHPATH:\\n\\n\\tsetenv XUSERFILESEARCHPATH $HOME/lib/app-defaults/%N\\n\\n    [ The \"comp.windows.x Frequently Asked Questions\" FAQ contains\\n    an excellent explanation of how these environment variables work.\\n    --ed.]\\n\\n    So, when xterm launches, it loads its resources from\\n    .../app-defaults/XTerm.  Xdvi finds them in .../app-defaults/XDvi,\\n    and so on and so forth.  Note that not all clients follow the same\\n    XXxxx resource-file naming pattern.  You can check in your system\\n    app-defaults directory (often: /usr/X11R5/lib/X11/app-defaults/) to\\n    find the proper name, and then name your personal resource files\\n    with the same name.\\n\\n    This is all documented in the Xt Specification (pg 125 & 666).\\n\\t\\t    [Thanks to: Kevin Samborn (samborn@mtkgc.com),\\n\\t\\t         Michael Urban (urban@cobra.jpl.nasa.gov),\\n\\t\\t             and Mike Long (mikel@ee.cornell.edu).\\n\\t     Kevin is willing mail his setup files to inquirers.]\\n\\n  This method of organizing your personal resources has the following\\n  benefits:\\n\\n    - Easier to maintain / more usable.\\n\\n    - Fewer resources are stored in the X server in the RESOURCE_MANAGER\\n      property.  As a side benefit your server may start fractionally\\n      quicker, since it doesn`t have to load all your resources.\\n\\n    - Applications only process their own resources, never have to sort \\n      through all of your resources to find the ones that affect them.\\n\\n  It also has drawbacks:\\n\\n    - the application that you are interested in has to load an\\n      additional file every time it starts up.  This doesn\\'t seem to\\n      make that much of a performance difference, and you might\\n      consider this a huge boon to usability.  If you are modifying an\\n      application\\'s resource database, you just need to re-run the\\n      application without having to \"xrdb\" again.\\n\\n    - xrdb will by default run your .Xdefaults file through cpp.  When\\n      your resources are split out into multiple resource files and\\n      then loaded by the individual client programs, they will not.\\n      WATCH OUT FOR THIS!!\\n\\n      I had C style comments in my .Xdefaults file, which cpp stripped\\n      out.  When I switched to this method of distributed resource\\n      files I spent several frustrating days trying to figure out why\\n      my clients were not finding their resources.  Xt did *NOT*\\n      provide any error message when it encountered the C style\\n      comments in the resource files, it simply, silently, aborted\\n      processing the resource file.\\n\\n      The loss of preprocessing (which can be very handy, e.g. ``#ifdef\\n      COLOR\\'\\' ...) is enough to cause some people to dismiss this\\n      method of resource management.\\n\\n    - You may also run into some clients which break the rules.  For\\n      example, neither Emacs (18.58.3) nor Xvt (1.0) will find their\\n      resources if they are anywhere other than in .Xdefaults.\\n\\n    - when starting up a client on a machine that does not share files\\n      with the machine where your resources are stored, your client\\n      will not find its resources.  Loading all your resources into the\\n      server will guarantee that all of your clients will always find\\n      their resources.            Casey Leedom (casey@gauss.llnl.gov)\\n\\n  A possible compromise suggestion that I have (and am planning on trying)\\n  is to put resources for all my heavily used clients (eg: xterm) into my\\n  .Xdefaults file, and to use the \"separate resources files\" method for\\n  clients that I seldom use.\\n\\nDefine Your Display Properly\\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\\n\\n  Client programs are often executed on the same machine as the server.  In\\n  that situation, rather than setting your DISPLAY environment variable to \\n  \"<hostname>:0.0\", where <hostname> is the name of your workstation, you\\n  should set your DISPLAY variable to \"unix:0.0\" or \":0.0\".  By doing this\\n  you access optimized routines that know that the server is on the same\\n  machine and use a shared memory method of transferring requests.\\n\\t\\t\\t[thanks to Patrick J Horgan (pjh70@ras.amdahl.com)]\\n\\n  See the _DISPLAY NAMES_ section of the X(1) man page for further\\n  explanation of how to properly set your display name.\\n\\n  \"I don\\'t think it\\'s stock MIT, but (at least) Data General and HP have\\n  libraries that are smart enough to use local communication even when\\n  the DISPLAY isn\\'t set specially.\"\\n\\t\\t\\t      Rob Sartin (88opensi!sartin@uunet.UU.NET)\\n\\n  [Jody Goldberg (jody@algorithmics.com) sent me an Xlib patch to change\\n  stock R5 to use local communication even if DISPLAY is not properly set.\\n  I don\\'t want to get in the business of distributing or trying to juggle\\n  non-MIT patches and so have elected not to include it here.

Think also\\n  about the _kind_ of programs you are running.  For example:  Is there\\n  a smaller clock program than xclock?\\n\\n  Unfortunately, I haven\\'t really noticed that programs advertise how large\\n  they are, so the onus is on us to do the research and spread the word.\\n\\n  [ Suggestions on better alternatives to the some of the standard clients\\n  (eg: Xclock, Xterm, Xbiff) are welcome.  --ed.]\\n\\n  I\\'ve received some contradictory advice from people, on the subject\\n  of X client programs.  Some advocate the use of programs that are\\n  strictly Xlib based, since Xt, Xaw and other toolkits are rather\\n  large.  Others warn us that other applications which you are using\\n  may have already loaded up one or more of these shared libraries.  In\\n  this case, using a non-Xt (for example) client program may actually\\n  _increase_ the amount of RAM consumed.\\n\\n  The upshot of all this seems to be: Don\\'t mix toolkits.  That is, try\\n  and use just Athena clients, or just Xview clients (or just Motif\\n  clients, etc).  If you use more than one, then you\\'re dragging in\\n  more than one toolkit library.\\n\\n  Know your environment, and think carefully about which client\\n  programs would work best together in that environment.\\n\\n\\t\\t  [Thanks to: Rob Sartin (88opensi!sartin@uunet.UU.NET),\\n      Duncan Sinclair (sinclair@dcs.gla.ac.uk | sinclair@uk.ac.gla.dcs) ]\\n\\nA Better Clock for X\\n- - - - - - - - - - -\\n\\n1) xcuckoo\\n   suggested by: Duncan Sinclair (sinclair@dcs.gla.ac.uk)\\n   available: on export.lcs.mit.edu\\n\\n   Xcuckoo displays a clock in the title bar of *another* program.\\n   Saves screen real estate.\\n\\n2) mclock\\n   suggested by: der Mouse (mouse@Lightning.McRCIM.McGill.EDU)\\n   available: larry.mcrcim.mcgill.edu (132.206.1.1) in /X/mclock.shar\\n\\n   Non Xt-based.

It is not\\n    noticeable on a 40MHz SPARC, but it does make a little difference\\n    on a [slower system].\\n\\n  This specific suggestion can probably be applied in general to lots\\n  of areas.

The 60 is the `aspect ratio'; it indicates the height of the\\n    sidewall of the tire relative to the overall width.  Our example tire\\n    has a sidewall height of 0.60 * 195 ~= 117 mm.  The 14 is the wheel\\n    diameter in inches; there are also some special tires called `TRX'\\n    tires which have three digit metric wheel diameter designations, like\\n    390, which is in millimeters.  The R means Radial, and the H is a speed\\n    rating indicating the highest speed at which the tire, when properly\\n    inflated and carrying an appropriate load, may safely operate.  Common\\n    speed ratings are S (112MPH), T (118MPH), H (130MPH), and V (up to\\n    150MPH.)\\n\\n    Recent changes to the method for specifying tire sizes move the speed\\n    rating to a different part of the designation; you may therefore find\\n    designations like 195/60R14 85H; the 85 indicates the per-tire load\\n    associated with the speed rating -- exceeding this load in continuous\\n    operation at the rated speed is dangerous practice.  What follows is\\n    a table showing a number of `load indices' and corresponding maximum\\n    per-tire loads:\\n\\n    Load Index       50   51   88   89   112   113   145   149   157\\n    Max Load (Kg)   190  195  560  580  1120  1150  2900  3250  4125\\n\\n    Note that the usual mass vs. weight confusion occurs in this table.\\n\\n    In some cases, the letters P or LT may be found in front of a tire\\n    size; the LT designation indicates Light Truck, and the P designation\\n    indicates Passenger car.  If no letter is given, then the application\\n    of the tire is Passenger car usage.  As far as I know, these letters\\n    only appear in the US market.  The LT designation is prinicipally of\\n    interest to owners of light trucks and other utility vehicles.  For\\n    the owner of a passenger vehicle, there is no meaningful difference\\n    between a tire with a P designation and one with no designation at\\n    all.\\n\\n    If the aspect ratio is omitted, it is probably 80, but may be 78.\\n\\n    Tires with an MS (mud/snow) designation may have their speed rating\\n    reduced by 20 km/h (about 12mph.)\\n\\n    There is an additional set of ratings on tires for temperature,\\n    traction, and treadwear.  Temperature and Traction are graded\\n    A, B, and C (with A the best and C the worst); treadwear is\\n    a numeric rating.  These values are of limited value, as they\\n    are assigned somewhat arbitrarily by tire manufacturers and are\\n    thus not useful in comparing different brands of tires.\\n\\nQ:  My car has tires with a funny size designation:  185/65HR390; can i put\\n    normal tires on the car?\\n\\nA:  Your tires are called TRX tires; they were devised by Michelin.\\n    Because of a somewhat different bead design, they are incompatible\\n    with normal tires; Michelin used a different diameter wheel for them\\n    so that they could not be mounted on the wrong type wheel (and so that\\n    more conventional tires could not be mounted on TRX type wheels.)\\n    You will need to aquire different wheels to put a normal tire on your\\n    car; it is barely possible to fit normal tires on TRX wheels, and horribly\\n    dangerous to do so (the tires may simply peel off the rims in a corner,\\n    or possibly blow out at high speed.)  TRX type tires are becoming hard\\n    to find; in addition to Michelin, Avon makes suitable tires.  Goodyear\\n    has apparently discontinued their line of TRX tires.\\n\\nQ:  Can I rotate radials from side to side, or rotate them only on one side\\n    of my car?\\n\\nA:  Car and tire manufacturers have differing views on this subject; many\\n    say that swapping radials between the left and right hand sides of a\\n    car is now ok (this group includes Michelin and Goodyear); others\\n    (for example, Pirelli and Nokia) will void warranties if such swapping\\n    is done.  The best advice is to read your tire manual carefully before\\n    rotating your tires, and stick to the manufacturer's recommendations.\\n\\nQ:  How many snow tires should I buy, and if I buy 2, which end of the\\n    car should I put them on?\\n\\nA:  In short, 4, and both ends.  To explain, many drivers in areas that don't\\n    get excessive snow or who don't drive agressively (or at all) in snow\\n    conditions get away with only two snows on the drive wheels, but there\\n    are circumstances where this can be dangerous practice.  With a rear\\n    wheel drive car, you can choose between being able to start the car\\n    going (a function of the rear axle) or stopping and turning the car\\n    (a function of the front axle.)  In a front wheel drive car, you start,\\n    stop, and turn with the front end.  The primary risk of putting the\\n    snow tires on the front only is that if you have to put on the brakes\\n    while going downhill, you run a serious risk of going downhill backwards.\\n\\nRadar Detectors and Speed Limits:\\n\\nQ:  Why aren't there any comments on Radar Detectors and Speed Limits\\n    in this Q&A posting?\\n\\nA:  Because questions about detectors and speed limits crossposted between\\n    misc.consumers and rec.autos.* always start long, tedious, and pointless\\n    flame wars.  If you want to talk about either of these topics, please\\n    subscribe to rec.autos or alt.flame and keep it there.\\n\\nSafety Equipment:\\n\\nQ:  Do airbags really work?\\n\\nA:  Preliminary statistics suggest the following:  Airbags work much\\n    better than no belts; good 3 point belts alone work much better than\\n    Airbags alone, and AirBags + 3 point belts work slightly better than\\n    3 point belts alone.  The con to airbags is that some designs tend\\n    to burn the driver's hands when venting the byproducts of the\\n    explosion that occurs inside the bag, and that some designs (but\\n    not all) may knock the driver's hands from the wheel, making retention\\n    of control of the vehicle after the bag deflates more difficult.\\n\\nBrake Questions:\\n\\nQ:  Do I always need to get the rotors on my disk brakes turned?  Midas\\n    always wants to do this.\\n\\nA:  No.  There are specific conditions that mandate turning or replacing\\n    rotors; some shops try and make a little extra money by replacing rotors\\n    more often than is strictly necessary.  if the rotors are not warped\\n    warped, and only lightly grooved, then there is no need to replace or\\n    to turn them.  Note also that some rotors (the rotors on many Hondas\\n    are a good example) are so narrow to begin with that it is not practical\\n    to turn them; they must be replaced when they become too thin, warped,\\n    or badly grooved.\\n\\nQ:  They tell me I should downshift when braking to slow my car down.  Is\\n    this really a good idea?\\n\\nA:  It used to be a very good idea, back in the days of mediocre, fade\\n    prone drum brakes.  In modern disc brake equipped cars, use of\\n    downshifting to slow the car is not really necessary, except in cases\\n    of long, steep downhill runs.  Otherwise, modern disc brakes are more\\n    than adequate to stop a passenger car in all circumstances, and they\\n    are much cheaper to repair than clutch linings.\\n\\n    On the other hand, many standard driver's license tests in the USA\\n    still specify that the driver being tested downshift under braking; I\\n    suggest that before taking a US driver's test, you either 1) learn to\\n    do this smoothly (which takes some time and practice) or 2) borrow a\\n    car with an automatic to take the test.\\n\\nQ:  How often should I replace my brake fluid?\\n\\nA:  Probably more often than you do.  Traditional brake fluids tend to\\n    absorb water; this water can corrode internal parts of the brake\\n    system and also lower the boiling point of the fluid.  DOT-3 type\\n    are older fluids; DOT-4 and DOT-5 are newer specifications.  The\\n    principal differences are in wet and dry boiling points; the dry\\n    boiling point is important in fresh brake fluid, but the wet boiling\\n    point is important in older brake fluid.  DOT-3 fluids have the lowest\\n    wet and dry boiling point _requirements_; DOT-4 fluids have better\\n    boiling point requirements; and DOT-5 fluids have the best boiling\\n    point requirements (but DOT-5 fluids are not clearly superior; see\\n    the next Q&A for more details.)  While the requirements imply that\\n    DOT-4 fluids are better than DOT-3 fluids, there may be specific\\n    cases where a DOT-3 fluid is preferable, but these are mostly\\n    competition applications.  Otherwise, DOT-4 type fluids offer _much_\\n    improved brake pedal feel.  Replacement once a year is recommended for\\n    DOT-4 fluids, although agressive drivers may profit by changing out\\n    fluid more frequently, or at least bleeding a modest amount of fluid\\n    out of the brake calipers fairly regularly.\\n\\nQ:  What about DOT-5 brake fluids?\\n\\nA:  This breaks down in to two parts.  The DOT-5 specification looks\\n    excellent for performance, but the first DOT-5 fluids were Silicone\\n    based.  Silicone fluids are a tricky proposition.  Unlike DOT-3 and\\n    DOT-4 fluids, they do not absorb water at all.  While this may sound\\n    like a feature, the problem is that any water present pools up in\\n    such systems, interfering with braking performance and corroding any\\n    metals at the spot where the pooling is occuring.  The water will tend\\n    to migrate downwards in the braking system to the brake calipers, where\\n    most of the corrosion occurs.\\n\\n    Because of this phenomenon, it is essential when converting to\\n    Silicone to empty the entire brake system and flush it throughly\\n    beforehand; some even recommend replacing all rubber parts in the\\n    brake system when converting to Silicone fluids.\\n\\n    Two other issues that come up with silicone fluids:  1) they are\\n    difficult to pour cleanly (that is, without air bubbles), which\\n    interferes with getting a good brake pedal feel, and 2) while they\\n    generally have much higher boiling points than DOT-4 fluids, they\\n    do have high temperature failure modes which are indistinguishable\\n    in effect from boiling DOT-4 fluids.  SIlicone fluids may make sense\\n    in some street car applications, but they are certainly not\\n    recommended for high performance driving applications, and the\\n    economics are questionable for street use.\\n\\n    I have recently become aware of new fluids that meet the DOT-5 standard\\n    that do not contain Silicones; these fluids appear to be reasonably\\n    compatible with the older DOT-3 and DOT-4 fluids, but I have little\\n    information at this time.\\n\\nQ:  ABS is available on some of the cars I'm looking at, but it costs\\n    more.  Is it worth it?\\n\\nA:  This does not have a cut and dried answer; therefore, this answer will\\n    be quite long in order to cover the pros and cons.  The short answer\\n    is that ABS costs more, both initially, and to maintain, will generally\\n    work better for the `average driver' (that is to say, a driver who does\\n    not have extensive experience in high performance driving techniques),\\n    and may require the `unlearning' of some obsolete braking techniques\\n    like pump braking which should be unlearned in any case.\\n\\n    Now for the long answer.  ABS works by monitering the wheels of the\\n    car, looking for signs of locked brakes.  It may or may not be able\\n    be able to distinguish between the different wheels (there are several\\n    systems on the market.)  It cannot detect impending lockup (which is\\n    what you would really want in an ideal world), but only the existence\\n    of lockup.  The sensors used vary; some of the less well designed\\n    sensors are sensitive to tire size, and to brake pad material, and\\n    may cease to function properly if the owner deviates from original\\n    equipment or OE-equivalent components.\\n\\n    When the sensors detect lockup, the ABS system responds by unlocking\\n    the brakes (either individually, or all at once, depending on the\\n    system.)  If the driver keeps their foot firmly planted, the ABS\\n    will end up cycling between the locked and unlocked states (if a\\n    sensor existed that could detect _impending lockup_, then we could\\n    sit right at that point, which is where maximum braking effect is\\n    achieved.)  This pulsing can often be felt in the brake pedal, as\\n    the system cycles.  The percentage of the time that the brakes are\\n    truly engaged is called the `duty cycle'; typically in an ABS system\\n    this is about 40%  On dry pavement, a trained driver can beat this\\n    duty cycle quite reliably using a technique called threshold braking;\\n    on wet pavement, braking is so chancy that ABS will outperform\\n    threshold braking nearly every time.  Unfortunately, on mud and on\\n    snow, often maximum braking effect can be acheived with the brakes\\n    locked; only Audi, of the manufacturers producing ABS-equipped cars,\\n    has seen fit to provide a disable switch for the ABS system for this\\n    eventuality.\\n\\n    A particularly important feature of ABS is that it preserves\\n    steering control.  This is the case simply because, if you are\\n    braking near the limit and turn the wheel, the ABS will release\\n    the brakes if it sees steering-triggered lockup, and back off\\n    on the percentage of the time that the brakes are applied.\\n    Braking distances will lengthen accordingly.\\n\\n    An important caution:  ABS cannot exceed the maximum theoretical\\n    braking force in any given situation; if you start sliding on\\n    glare ice, don't expect an ABS system to help you out very much.\\n    The coefficient of friction is not changed by the presence of an\\n    ABS system in your car.\\n\\n    As far as maintenence goes, in addition to the potential\\n    restrictions I've listed above, you have to worry about the\\n    following:  1) parts costs are much higher; the OE master cylinder\\n    for my obscure european sedan lists for $185, but the OE master\\n    cylinder for the ABS-equipped version of the same car lists for\\n    over $1000.  Most manufacturers explicitly forbid use of DOT-5\\n    (silicone) brake fluids in ABS-equipped vehicles.  Because of\\n    the potential cost of replacement of corroded brake system\\n    components, regular (I suggest annual) replacement of brake fluid\\n    becomes very important.\\n\\nQ:  What about this threshold braking business?\\n\\nA:  [normally, I'd not put this in the consumers Q&A, but recent\\n    publicity about a number of accidents involving police drivers\\n    in ABS-equipped Chevy Caprices suggests that this section is\\n    needed here -- rpw]\\n\\n    Threshold braking is a technique practiced by all serious high\\n    performance drivers; if made a habit, it replaces the `stab\\n    the pedal and lock 'em up' panic habit entirely, and is much\\n    to be prefered.  Basically, the premise is that tires generate\\n    maximum braking force when they have just started to slide, but\\n    just before the wheels lock up entirely.  Drivers who threshold\\n    brake learn to feel what this `threshold' feels like, and learn\\n    to search for it and hit it on the application of the brake\\n    pedal.  In many cars, you can feel that you are near the\\n    threshold when the pedal starts to firm up as you depress it.\\n    In any case, if you can't hear the tires whine just a bit, you're\\n    not very near the threshold.\\n\\n    In a car with ABS, often there is a twinge in the pedal just\\n    before the system starts cycling; if the driver backs off on\\n    the pedal just a tad when the twinge is felt, then they are very\\n    close to the threshold and they'll probably achieve better\\n    stopping distances than if they just punched it and let the ABS\\n    take over.\\n\\n    Recently, there has been a rash of publicity over a number of\\n    accidents, and one death, involving police cars equipped with\\n    ABS systems.  The police departments in question quickly blamed\\n    the new ABS systems, but according to Autoweek magazine, it now\\n    seems clear that the problem was a lack of training; none of the\\n    involved officers had any recent performance driving training.\\n    There is reason to believe that the drivers reacted to the pulsing\\n    brake pedal by `pump braking', an old and discredited technique\\n    of stabbing and releasing the brake pedal, the goal being to\\n    try and get brakes back with a failing hydraulic system.  If you\\n    think about it for a minute, you'll realize that pump braking must\\n    cut the effective operation of a working brake system by at least\\n    1/2, so if you cut the 40% duty cycle of an ABS system by that\\n    much, you are giving up most of your brakes for the wrong reason.\\n    Threshold braking has the advantage in that it is an effective\\n    and useful technique regardless of whether your car has ABS; if\\n    you do fear a failed hydraulic system, then one or two stabs at\\n    the pedal will be sufficient.    \\n\\nGas Questions:\\n\\nQ:  Does High Octane gasoline help?\\n\\nA:  Maybe, maybe not.  Some cars have knock sensors, and can adjust the\\n    engine timing or turbocharger boost to suit the gasoline being used.\\n    On most cars, however, you should use the cheapest gas that makes your\\n    car run well.  Check your owner's manual for details on what your car\\n    needs.\\n\\nQ:  My car was made for leaded gasoline.  Will unleaded gas hurt it?\\n\\nA:  It is possible that unleaded gas may *slightly* increase valve wear,\\n    although the Amoco Oil company argues otherwise.  The actual increase\\n    in valve wear will be almost unnoticeable, however, as modern leaded\\n    gasolines actually contain very little lead.  You should, however,\\n    check your owner's manual; many cars from the early 1970s do not\\n    actually require leaded gasoline.\\n\\nQ:  Do fuel treatments help?  What kind should I use?\\n\\nA:  Some do and some don't.  During the winter, it is a good idea to use\\n    dry gas; however, some may be harmful to fuel injection systems.\\n    Never use an additive containing Methanol (sometimes called Methyl\\n    Alcohol); such additives may damage fuel systems in cars with carbs\\n    and almost certainly will damage cars with fuel injection.\\n\\n    Manufacturer's opinions vary on additives containing Ethanol (sometimes\\n    called Ethyl Alcohol); if your car has fuel injection, check the owner's\\n    manual on your car before  using these.  Most manufacturers consider\\n    10% Ethanol acceptable in gasoline.  Additives with Isopropyl Alcohol\\n    (Isopropanol), and Petroleum  Distillates are fine in fuel injected\\n    cars.\\n\\n    An occasional bottle of fuel injector cleaner is helpful in cars with\\n    fuel injectors, although many premium gasolines contain detergents that\\n    do the same job.  Some off brands of fuel injector cleaners contain\\n    Ethanol or Methanol; always check the ingredients before putting anything\\n    in your gas tank.\\n\\n    There are a small number of particularly good additives; these are\\n    noticeably more expensive that the run-of-the-mill ones, but work\\n    much, much better.  Among these are Chevron Techron, Redline SL-1,\\n    Wurth `Lubrimoly Ventil Sauber', and BG 44K.  A bottle of one of these,\\n    once every six months, is highly recommended.\\n\\nQ:  What about detergent gasolines?\\n\\nA:  The quality of detergent packages in gasolines varies somewhat; BMW\\n    has instituted a testing program, and gasoline brands which pass this\\n    test may advertise that fact.  Stickers indicating passage of the test\\n    are now beginning to appear on fuel pumps at gas stations.  If such\\n    gasolines are used, then fuel injector cleaners are probably optional.\\n    Beforewarned that while use of BMW approved gasolines will keep a clean\\n    engine clean, they may not clean a motor with bad valve deposits.\\n\\nLubrication Questions:\\n\\nQ:  What do the numbers and letters in a motor oil designation mean?\\n\\nA:  There are several different items encoded.  There is a two-letter\\n    code indicating the type of detergent package that the manufacturer\\t\\n    uses in the oil; this looks like SE,SF,CD or such.  The S codes are\\n    for gasoline engine applications; the C codes are for diesel engine\\n    applications.  The second letter is assigned in sequence as new levels\\n    of protection are developed; thus SF is considered better than SE,\\n    SE is considered better than SD, and so forth.\\n\\n    The more noticeable designation is the oil weight.  This is either\\n    a single number (e.g., 30 weight) or a pair of numbers separated by\\n    the letter W (e.g., 10W30.)  The latter type is much more commonly\\n    used these days, and are the only type that most automobile\\n    manufacturers specify in operators manuals.  The first number in the\\n    designation (10W) is the apparent viscosity of the oil when it is cold;\\n    the W stands for `winter'.  The second number (30) is the viscosity\\n    of the oil when hot.  There is a trick here; the oil doesn't actually\\n    get thicker (turn from 10 weight to 30 weight) as it gets hotter.  What\\n    is actually happening is that when the oil is cold, it has the viscosity\\n    of a cold 10 weight oil.  as it gets hotter, it doesn't get thin as fast\\n    as a 10W oil would; by the time it is up to temperature, it has the\\n    viscosity of a hot 30 weight oil.\\n\\n    Note that these numbers actually specify ranges of viscosities; not\\n    all 10W oils have exactly the same viscosity when cold, and not all\\n    30 weight oils have the same viscosity when hot.  Note also that the\\n    novel behaviour of multi-grade oils is caused by additives, and it has\\n    been reported that with the sole exception of Castrol GTX, 10W40 oils\\n    do not retain their multi-grade characteristics well over time.  10W30,\\n    15W40, and 20W50 oils work very well, though.\\n\\nQ:  Are `quick lube' places any good?\\n\\nA:  Some do adequate work, but there are quite a few incompetent ones out\\n    there.  Let the buyer beware, watch them while they work, make sure\\n    that they don't overtorque the oil drain plug, and keep your hand on\\n    your wallet at all times.\\n\\nQ:  Are oil additives like Slick-50 or Tufoil any good?\\n\\nA:  Slick-50 and Tufoil are PTFE-based additives.  Many of these have\\n    come onto the market recently; they are different from the moly-based\\n    additives that have been around since the early 50's.  PTFE is the\\n    chemical name for Teflon(TM), a trademark owned by DuPont. In general,\\n    auto manufacturers do not recommend use of these products.  Most USENET\\n    responses to questions on these additives are favorable (slight\\n    increase of MPG after application, smoother revving) but long term\\n    results (whether PTFE additives are effective after 5K miles) are\\n    debatable.  Some manufacturers (such as Saab) claim that either the\\n    product or the engine flush that preceeds application causes\\n    deterioration of the oil seals and eventual leakage.  Some BMW owners\\n    have reported death of valve seals shortly after the addition of\\n    Slick 50 to their cars.  This writer has been cautioned by a Slick-50\\n    Dealer (!) that Slick-50 should _not_ be used in Japanese motors, as\\n    it may clog the oil return passages in the engine.  Otherwise, there are\\n    no known reports of damage caused by PTFE additives.\\n\\n    On the other hand, there are satified Slick 50 customers in the world.\\n\\nQ:  Do synthetic oils really work?\\n\\nA:  Yes, but.  More specifically, most auto manufactuers accept synthetics,\\n    but disagree with the extremely long oil change intervals claimed by\\n    oil manufacturers.  Auto manufacturers recommend that you continue to\\n    change oil at the intervals recommended in the owners manual for your\\n    car.  Even if you decide to try the longer intervals, at least change\\n    the oil filter at regular intervals, as synthetics get just as dirty\\n    as conventional oils.\\n\\n    Synthetic gear lubricants for manual transmissions are another matter\\n    entirely; Amsoil, Redline, and AGIP are very highly regarded and very\\n    effective.  Mobil 1 synthetic gear lube gets mixed reviews, however.\\n\\nQ:  Manufacturers are specifying longer and longer oil change intervals.\\n    How often should I change my oil?\\n\\nA:  It depends on how you drive.  If your car always (or nearly always)\\n    gets warmed up, and you don't drive it very hard and keep the revs\\n    down, the manufacturer's recommendation is probably fine.  If, however,\\n    you drive it hard, drive it at high revs, or alternatively, if you\\n    only drive it to and from the supermarket so that it doesn't get up\\n    to temperature, then you may wish to change oil much more often,\\n    perhaps at 3000 mile intervals (given that most manufacturers are\\n    now specifying 7500 mile intervals.)  If you don't drive your car\\n    much at all (say 7500 miles a year), then you probably want to change\\n    oil every six months anyway.  If you are storing a car during the winter,\\n    then change oil before storing it and change oil when you bring it out\\n    of storage.\\n\\nMisc. Questions:\\n\\nQ:  My car has a timing belt.  I hear that bad things happen when they\\n    break.  What's the story?\\n\\nA:  It depends on the internal design of the motor.  Early Ford Escorts,\\n    for example, will suffer severe valve damage if the belt breaks, but\\n    the newer cars will just require a tow and installation of a new belt.\\n    Some Honda motors will not be damaged, but others will be.\\n\\n    If no replacement interval is specified for your car, then change the\\n    belt at least every 60,000 miles; some cars may require more frequent\\n    replacement.  Ask your dealer or independent mechanic.  Also, ask if\\n    there are any related repairs that should take place at the same time\\n    (for example, the same Ford Escorts that suffer valve damage also have\\n    a timing belt driven water pump, which has been known to seize,\\n    destroying the timing belt, and which then causes major valve damage\\n    as a side effect.  Replacing the timing belt while ignoring the water\\n    pump can be a costly mistake.)\\n\\nQ:  Why would anyone be stupid enough to design a motor so that it\\n    self destructs when the timing belt breaks?\\n\\nA:  For performance reasons.  Compromising piston design so that the\\n    valves and pistons will not collide requires that the compression\\n    ratio of the engine be reduced significantly; this is why you are\\n    more likely to avoid valve damage in economy cars than in performance\\n    oriented vehicles.\\n\\nQ:  What causes Unintended Acceleration?\\n\\nA:  The final report of the National Highway, Transportation, and Safety\\n    Administration concluded that unintended acceleration could not be\\n    caused by any mechanical failure of the vehicle in question and at the\\n    same time be consistent with the physical evidence.  The NHTSA report\\n    goes on to conclude that `pedal misapplication' by the vehicle operator\\n    is probably the cause.\\n-- \\nrichard welty        518-393-7228       welty@cabot.balltown.cma.com\\n``Nothing good has ever been reported about the full rotation of\\n  a race car about either its pitch or roll axis''  -- Carroll Smith\\n\",\n",

For\\n>example, the translation:\\n>\\tShift<Key>q:\\tquit()\\n>will take effect even if the Ctrl key is held down at the same time as\\n>the Shift key (and the q key).\\n\\nThis is true for accelerators and mnemonics, which are implemented using\\nevent handlers instead of grabs; it\\'s not true for menu accelerators.  If\\nyou\\'re a Motif implementor, I\\'d suggest lobbying to get the Xlib semantics\\nchanged to support the feature I described above.  Otherwise, change the\\ndocumentation for menu accelerators to properly set the user\\'s\\nexpectations, because menu accelerators are NOT the same thing as\\ntranslations.\\n\\n>Is it possible to supply > 1 accelerator for a menu entry?\\n\\nIf you mean \"menu accelerator\", no it\\'s not possible.  That\\'s according to\\nthe definition of the XmNaccelerator resource in the XmLabel manual page.\\n\\n>Keep in mind when answering this question that when using Motif you\\n>can\\'t use XtInstallAccelerators().\\n\\nI can\\'t think of a reason why not.\\n\\n>How can you ensure that accelerators work the same independent of\\n>case?  What I want is Ctrl+O and Ctrl+o to both be accelerators on one\\n>menu entry.\\n\\nThere is a workaround for Motif users.  In addition to the normal menu\\naccelerator you install on the XmPushButton[Gadget], set an XtNaccelerators\\nresource on the shell (TopLevel or Application).  Install the shell\\'s\\naccelerators on itself and all of its descendants with\\nXtInstallAllAccelerators (shell, shell).\\n\\nFor example,\\n\\n  applicationShell - mainWindow - menuBar - fileCascade\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t  -- filePulldown - openPushbutton\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t  - exitPushbutton\\n\\n  *openPushbutton.accelerator = Ctrl<Key>O\\n  *openPushbutton.acceleratorText = Ctrl+O\\n  *exitPushbutton.accelerator = Ctrl<Key>Q\\n  *exitPushbutton.acceleratorText = Ctrl+Q\\n\\n  *applicationShell.accelerators = #override\\\\n\\\\\\n    Ctrl<Key>O: PerformAction(*openPushbutton, ArmAndActivate)\\\\n\\\\\\n    Ctrl<Key>Q: PerformAction(*exitPushbutton, ArmAndActivate)\\n\\nYou have to write and add the application action PerformAction, which you\\ncan implement by using XtNameToWidget on the first argument and then\\nXtCallActionProc with the rest of the arguments.\\n\\nI tested out something similar to this.  To shorten development time, I\\nused TeleUSE\\'s TuNinstallAccelerators resource to install the accelerators\\non the shell, and I directly invoked the Open and Quit D actions instead\\nof asking the pushbuttons to do it for me, but the more general approach I\\ndescribed above should work.\\n\\n-- Trevor Bourget (trevor@telesoft.com)\\n',\n",

Jagr did not have a better season than\\n     Francis ... to suggest otherwise is an insult to those with a modicum of\\n     hockey knowledge.  Save your almost maniacal devotion to the almighty\\n     plus/minus ... it is the most misleading hockey stat available.\\n\\n     Until the NHL publishes a more useful quantifiable statistic including ice\\n     time per game and some measure of its \"quality\" (i.e., is the player put out\\n     in key situations like protecting a lead late in the game; is he matched up\\n     against the other team\\'s top one or two lines; short-handed, etc), I would\\n     much rather see the +/- disappear altogether instead of having its dubious\\n     merits trumpeted by those with little understanding of its implications.\\n\\nThank you for posting this.  As the person who first brought up the\\nfact that Jagr has a much higher +/- than Francis, I can assure you\\nthat I brought it up as an example of the absurdity of +/-\\ncomparisons, even on the same team.  I never, ever thought that anyone\\nwould argue that Jagr\\'s higher +/- actually reflected better two-way\\nplay.\\n\\nIn my opinion, Francis\\'s low +/- is purely a result of him being asked\\nto play against opponents top scorers at all times; the fact that he\\ncan chip in 100 points while neutralizing the other team\\'s top center\\nis a testament to how valuable he is, even if his +/- suffers.  On the\\nother hand, Jagr, for how big, fast and skilled he is, can\\'t even get\\n90 points, no matter how inflated his +/- is.\\n\\n(By the way, don\\'t get me wrong -- I like Jagr.  He may be a lazy\\nfloater, but he turns it on at exactly the right times -- like\\novertime of playoff games).\\n\\n--\\nRoland Dreier                                        dreier@math.berkeley.edu\\n',\n",

Hrudey made 21 saves in Sundays\\n6-3 opening victory.\\n\\nBut Stauber clearly is upset with his sudden status as the No. 3 man behind Rick\\nKnickle.  Stauber had a 4-1-2 record and 2.98 goals-against average down the\\nstretch in the regular season and nearly wrestled the No. 1 job from Hrudey.\\n\\nKnickle?  He won 2 of 3 decisions but had a bloated 5.26 average, twice was \\nyanked from games (once for stomach cramps) and hasn\\'t played since March 29.\\n\\nYet, when the series resumes Wednesday, Knickle will serve as Hrudey\\'s backup\\nagain and Stauber will have to satisfy his playoff hunger by munching on Olympic\\nSaddledome popcorn.\\n\\n\"If I\\'m supposedly close to being the starter or could have been the starter...I\\ndropped too. 3.  What happened to No. 2?\"  Stauber wondered.  \"Not that I\\'d be\\nhappy with No. 2, but I feel I should at least be a part of this team in the\\nplayoffs.\"\\n\\nPerhaps Stauber eventually will get his chance, but Melrose apparently is not\\nconvinced the 25-year old is capable of handling playoff pressure.\\n\\nWhile insisting he is the Kings\\' \"goalie of the future,\" Melrose said Stauber\\nflubbed all four of the big games he was asked to win this season.  They were,\\naccording to Melrose: a 7-2 loss to San Jose on Dec. 26; An 8-3 loss to the New\\nYork Rangers on Jan. 23; a 6-6 tie with Detroit on Feb. 11; an 8-6 loss to \\nVancouver on Thursday.\\n\\n\"Four times this season Robb could have emerged as the elite goalie, he could\\nhave taken it away from Kelly Hrudey, and he didn\\'t do it,\" Melrose said.  \"An\\nelite goaltender has to carry the ball when you give it to him.  The mark of a\\ngreat goalie is that he isn\\'t satisfied to be a backup.\"\\n\\n\"I\\'m not blaming Robb for the losses, but if you\\'re going to be No. 1, you\\'ve\\ngot to be able to walk your talk.  You\\'ve got to be able to play when everything\\nis on the line.  Robb Stauber has a great deal of ability, but maybe I expect\\nmore from him than he does.\"\\n\\nOuch.  That remark stung Stauber.  He began the season 9-0-1, struggled when the\\nteam hit a mid-season slump, didn\\'t play for a month after Knickle was signed\\noff the San Diego Gulls roster, then came on at the end.\\n\\n\"I expect more from myself than anybody, including Barry Melrose,\" said Stauber,\\na three-year star at the University of Minnesota who left school in 1989, only \\nto have his development hampered by a string of serious injuries.\\n\\n\"What I\\'ve been through the last four years - two knee operations, a herniated\\ndisk in my back, shoulder surgery - what more can I go through?  I obviously do\\nexpect a lot from myself, otherwise I wouldn\\'t be here.\"\\n\\n\"Anybody who would disagree with that doesn\\'t know me.  I\\'m not saying Barry \\ndoesn\\'t know me, but don\\'t say I\\'ve been without expectations.  If anything, I\\'m\\na perfectionist.\"\\n\\nStauber acknowledged he played poorly in the four games Melrose mentioned. \"But \\neven though I didn\\'t play well, I get knocked down from maybe on to three? It\\'s \\na bit of a jump,\" he said.  \"You\\'re almost No. 1, or if you play a good game \\nyou\\'re No. 1 and if you don\\'t you\\'re No. 3?  Why does Jack Nicklaus shoot a 67 \\nand then a 75?  Can you explain that?  That\\'s what barry wanted me to explain \\nto him, why I didn\\'t come through when he counted on me.  I don\\'t know. What I \\ndo know is, it\\'s a sport.  I\\'ll be there.\"\\n\\nMelrose\\'s \"goalie of the future\" statement doesn\\'t mean much to Stauber. \"Before\\nyou know it, I\\'ll be 30 and there will be no future,\" he said.\\n\\n------\\n\\n*Game 1 of the Kings @ Flames playoff series drew a 4.2 Nielsen rating on ABC \\nChannel 7 here in LA.

It was never a very stable package, but now it seems to crash every  \\nday.  The worst part about it is that it does not crash consistently: ie I  \\ncan't reproduce crashes, and they are not always GPF's in the same  \\napplication. Sometimes I can recover by simply closing the application  \\nthat caused an error, but other times, windows acts very strange, and I  \\nneed to re-boot.\\n\\nSome background:  I have a Leading Edge 486sx25 with Phoenix BIOS.  When I  \\nfirst got it it had 4Mg of memory.  It ran windows fine (not too many  \\nGPF's).  Then, a couple of weekends ago, I installed Lotus 123 for windows  \\n(with ATM), a game card and an additional 4  1Mg SIMMS.  The Leading edge  \\nmachine is kind of strange, in that it has the IDE controler built into  \\nthe motherboard, the CPU is actually on a sparate board that plugs into  \\nthe motherboard and the SIMMS it uses are Macintosh SIMMS! Apparently I  \\nwas told that the Leading Edge had the parity bit built into the mother  \\nboard.  The original 4Mg 80ns SIMMS where of the 2 chip variety from  \\nSAMSUNG, and the ones I installed are 8 chip SIMMS. They are recognized  \\nfine by the BIOS RAM check. The game card is a generic $20 gamecard.\\n\\nThe reason why I mention the hardware like this is that sometimes  \\nrebooting the machine using the reset button or ctl-alt-del still leaves  \\nthe machine kind of flaky, but turning it on and off doesn't. \\n\\nI haven't tried taking out the RAM or the game card, because as I said  \\nthese GPF are not reproducible at will.  I have gone through and entire  \\nday using the computer with no problems and then I might get 5 or so GPF's  \\nin the sppace of 20 minutes?\\n\\nWhat can I do.  This situation is most annoying... Are there any good  \\ndiagnostic tools for hardware? Do you think that this might be a software  \\nproblem (ie EMM386 etc.)? If it helps, i have manage to get GPF's on After  \\nDark, quicken, Paint shop pro.
